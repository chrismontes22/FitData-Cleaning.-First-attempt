Hypertrophy vs Strength Training : What Are The Differences? 


 There are some key differences between training for hypertrophy vs strength. 

 Hypertrophy refers to increasing the size of the muscle, which is done by increasing the overall volume of your workout ( sets x reps ).   Strength training refers to increasing the ability of a muscle to produce force, which is done through lifting heavier weights ( above 85 % of 1 rep max ). 

 In short, hypertrophy is how big a muscle is, while strength is how strong a muscle is. 

 Understanding the differences between hypertrophy vs strength training is important to understand since it is going to impact the types of workouts and protocols you do in the gym. 

 In this article, I will explain : 

     Pros vs Cons of Hypertrophy vs Strength Training 
     The Differences Between Hypertrophy and Strength Training? 
     Who Should Do Hypertrophy vs Strength Training? 

 What Is Hypertrophy? 
 hypertrophy is the physiological process of increasing the size of muscle fibers through resistance training 

 Hypertrophy is the physiological process of increasing the size of muscle fibers, typically in diameter, through resistance training. 

 There are two main types of muscle hypertrophy : sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and myofibril hypertrophy.   

     Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is what most people mean when they refer to hypertrophy training.   It is the physical increase of the muscle. 

     Myofibril hypertrophy is when a muscle becomes more dense and compact. 

 These types of hypertrophy usually happen together, and so for practical purposes the distinction does not really matter.   But if you continue to read more about this topic, you will probably run into these terms, which is why it is worth mentioning. 
 Benefits of Hypertrophy Training 

 Below are four benefits of hypertrophy training. 

 Note that many of these benefits can also be seen with strength training as well, especially in beginner lifters. 
 Builds More Muscle 

 While both hypertrophy and strength training build muscle, the general consensus is that hypertrophy based training allows for greater increases in muscle size and growth than heavier, strength based training. 

 Hypertrophy training allows lifters to train in higher volumes, for longer periods of time, which has been shown to be one of the most significant and effective variables for muscle growth 

 Less Risk of Injury 

 Weight training entails lifting weights, and some injury risks are part of the process. 

 That said, hypertrophy training often has less risk of injury due to lighter loads and less injury risk when training closure to failure. 
 Increased Energy Expenditure 

 Energy expenditure can be increased by increasing your output. In other words, the more work you do ( training volume ), the more calories you burn. 

 Hypertrophy training is known to have higher levels of sets, reps, and overall volume, and therefore may be a great option for lifters who are looking to increase muscle while also burning a ton of calories. 

 This is not to say the heavier strength based programs do not burn calories, because they certainly do. What it means however is that lifting with lighter to moderate loads, with more reps, will equate to more work being done ( training volume ), and that can increase calorie expenditure. 


 Improves Muscular Symmetry 

 Hypertrophy training allows you to back off on focusing on moving a load from point A to point B, and really learn how to engage muscles, attack lagging muscle groups, and correct movement asymmetries. 

 When training with heavier loads, it may be difficult to think about how the muscle feels or how to slow the moment down, as the load itself is one rep away from cruising you. 

 Hypertrophy training gives you the opportunity to build some more muscle awareness and improve muscle growth and symmetry, so that when it comes time to lift heavier loads you are in a more prepared and more injury - proofed state. 
 Drawbacks of Hypertrophy Training 

 Below are two potential drawbacks of hypertrophy training. 

 Note that these limitations are less significant with beginners, as they often can increase their strength at the same time they build muscle, and are often able to handle more volume simply because their absolute loading is often less than a more advanced lifter. 
 May Not Increase Strength as Effectively as Strength Specific Training 

 Research shows that the increases in muscle size ( often due to sarcoplasmic hypertrophy ) does not always lead to increases in functional strength of force output. 

 This is especially the case with more advanced lifters, and is why most lifters will train hypertrophy the farthest away from a strength competition to allow them to train hypertrophy properly, then shift back into a more strength focused program. 

 By doing a program that progresses from hypertrophy to strength, the lifter is able to reap the benefits of both training programs. 
 Could Result in Overuse Injuries without Adequate Recovery 

 Training hypertrophy means you are often training in higher volumes, which may result in you training more than your recovery allows. 

 While this is often remedied by more sleep, more food, and a better training program that can track your progress and adjust as needed based on your progress, it is still something to be aware of. 

 What Is Strength? 

 Strength can be defined as the ability to generate maximal force through a muscle contraction. 

 Strength is often demonstrated through heavy lifting and maxing out. 

 The ability to generate maximum levels of force is dependent on a few key factors, such as : the central nervous system, rate of force production, and neural fatigue. 

 Central Nervous System 

 The central nervous system is the control center for all movement and hard training.   It is made up of your brain and spinal cord. 

 When you train heavy, you train the nervous system to withstand heavier loads without inhibiting your ability to train hard. 

 The more your nervous system is prepared for heavy loads, the less likely you are to pick something up and feel instantly tired or drained. 

 This is one of the main benefits of strength training and one of the more specific outcomes of heavy training. 
 Rate of Force Production 

 Faster rates of force production equate to more force being produced at once, which can help you move heavier loads more efficiently, be more explosive, and break through sticking points. 

 You can develop this by lifting heavier loads, as well as lifting loads with more velocity ( speed ). 
 Neural Fatigue 

 This occurs when the central nervous system does not have enough recovery time due to lifting too heavy, doing too many sets and reps, or training too much in general. 

 When neural fatigue occurs, you will often feel overly sluggish, have decreased performance and motivation, and will need to take often some time off, often weeks, from heavier training. 
 Benefits of Strength Training 

 Below are two benefits of strength training. 

 While hypertrophy programs can offer some beginners these benefits, more advanced lifters or lifters who have not done a proper strength training program will find that a more strength specific training program offers them these benefits. 
 Increases Neural Drive and Peak Strength 

 Strength specific training increases the central nervous system is ability to send impulses to the muscle fibers to contract. 

 These impulses can improve the rate at which the muscle fiber contracts ( rate of force production ) as well as how many of them contract at once ( firing synchronization ). 

 Both of these factors will allow you to move heavier loads more efficiently. 
 Can Maintain or Build Strength While Training Less 

 Heavier strength training can help you maintain strength when cutting, mainly due to the central nervous system being stimulated under heavier loads. 

 When people eat less, they often think they need to stop lifting heavy, but rather, they should keep some heavier lifting in as they can not lose as much strength during a weight loss phase. 

 This is very important for strength based athletes who are losing weight for competition. 
 Drawbacks of Strength Training 

 Below are two potential ( and likely ) drawbacks of strength training, especially when done in excessive volumes, poor recovery, improper form, or lack of a deloading. 
 Can Lead to Neural Fatigue More Easily Than Hypertrophy 

 Fatigue can happen during any period where you are training harder than you can recover from, however, neural fatigue often occurs during high volume, higher intensity ( loading ) strength programs. 

 While there are no clear guidelines on what constitutes something being too high in volume or intensity, as individual recovery rates can vary, it is often seen when lifters train too heavy for too long or for too many reps. 

 For example, doing 6 - 8 sets of 5 reps with 85 % or more loads on things like back squats and deadlifts, and going to all out failure every set, multiple times a week, for weeks on end. 

 Since the nervous system becomes much more involved when heavier loads are lifted, it can also be fatigued more easily at higher intensities and higher volumes. 

 If you do overly tax your nervous system, the recovery process is much longer than taking a few days off of training, often several weeks until you feel fully recovered. Neural fatigue is often a more serious issue with more advanced lifters or lifters who also have high stressors outside the gym. 
 May Increase Risk of Injury and/or Overuse Injury 

 Lifting in high volumes and training hard, no matter the training program ( hypertrophy vs strength ) can result in some injuries if proper form and recovery is not prioritized. 

 Strength training, however, can increase injury risks and overuse injuries, especially with poor recovery, high stress, and high volume strength programs, as the loading is higher than that used in hypertrophy programs. 
 7 Differences Between Hypertrophy & Strength 
 7 differences between hypertrophy and strength 

 The 7 differences between hypertrophy and strength are : 

     Training Volume Is Higher in Hypertrophy Than Strength Training 
     Total Sets Performed is Not Significantly Different in Hypertrophy vs Strength Programs 
     Reps Ranges are Higher In Hypertrophy Programs Than Strength Programs 
     Loads Should Be Lighter When Training for Hypertrophy 
     You Can Train Closer to Fatigue More When Training for Hypertrophy 
     Compound Exercises Are Best for Strength Development 
     Rest Periods Can Be As Long As Needed for Both Hypertrophy and Strength 

 Training Volume Is Higher in Hypertrophy Than Strength Training 

 One of the main differences between hypertrophy training and strength training is the total amount of work volume accumulated within a session and program. 

 Training volume can be calculated by multiplying sets x reps x load, and generally speaking hypertrophy training is higher in training volume due to the ability to perform more sets and reps with less loads than heavier, strength training. 

 This is not to say that you can not train in higher frequencies with heavier loads, however, fatigue ( neural ) and overuse injury ( strains, tendinitis, connective tissues ) becomes much more of a factor when trying to do heavier loads in higher volumes. 
 Total Sets Performed is Not Significantly Different in Hypertrophy vs Strength Programs 

 Both hypertrophy and strength programs will have a lifter perform 2 - 5 sets of a given movement, however in some cases 5 - 10 sets may be programmed during strength training programs because of the reduced number of reps. 

 The total number of sets performed can vary greatly based on the program, and is often not a key differentiator between hypertrophy vs strength training, as reps and loading are often manipulated to a great extent. 
 Reps Ranges are Higher In Hypertrophy Programs Than Strength Programs 

 Hypertrophy rep ranges can vary greatly when compared to strength training rep ranges. 

 Hypertrophy can occur in a wide variety of rep ranges, as the key driver for muscle growth is often training the muscle to fatigue and getting the muscle burn, which can be done training in the 5 - 10, 10 - 20, and even 20 - 30 rep range ; as long as the muscle is taken to failure. 

 If the muscle is not taken to failure after 25 - 30 reps, the loading is too light to bring about significant improvements in muscle hypertrophy. 

 Similarly, if the lifter fatigues prior to 5 reps, muscle damage is done, but not enough overall training volume can be accomplished often due to the lifter getting generally tired before the muscle itself has been fatigued. 

 This is why most programs recommend you to train in the 8 - 15 reps range to failure or very close to failure for best results if your goal is hypertrophy. 

 If you are looking to increase strength, your rep ranges will often be between 1 - 5 reps per set, as the loading is above 80 % of your maximum ( for example 5 X 5 workout @ 80 % load ). 

 If you are training more reps than that, you are certainly increasing muscle, however you may not actually be using heavy enough loads to increase your strength maximally. 
 Loads Should Be Lighter When Training for Hypertrophy 

 Training intensity refers to the load, more specialty how heavy it is relative to the lifter is maximum. 

 Muscle hypertrophy occurs using loads between 30 - 80 % of one is one - rep max, whereas strength training typically occurs above the 80 % of their one - rep max. 

 This is a key difference between the two, as you can have significant increases in muscle growth and size with lighter loads ( 30 - 80 % of max ), however you need to lift above 80 % to bring about the neural adaptations that take place to increase strength output. 
 You Can Train Closer to Fatigue More When Training for Hypertrophy 

 When hypertrophy is the goal, you can often train close to failure as the loads are lighter and the failure is muscle failure rather than the body as a whole giving out. 

 When looking to increase muscle size and growth, local muscle failure ( such as what you feel in your quads when you do a ton of seated leg extensions ) is the name of the game. 

 Strength training is often more effective when you do not train to complete failure, as you run the risk of overtraining and injury as loading is much higher relative to your maximum. 
 Compound Exercises Are Best for Strength Development 

 During hypertrophy training programs, the goal is to train the muscle to fatigue, which can be done using a variety of loads, rep ranges, and movements. 

 When training to failure it is often helpful to use machines and isolated movement as you can truly push the muscle to fatigue and not be limited by other muscles giving out or form breakdowns. 

 However, if you are looking to increase max strength, you need to train movements that allow you to train with heavier loads. 

 Compound exercises are great for this, and the limiting factor for these will often be how heavy the load is rather than how much balance or coordination you need, or exercises that may not allow you to load up as much weight.  

 For example, doing back squats with a barbell is much easier to load up 315lbs than it is to do kettlebell goblet squats with 315lbs. 

 Research suggests that if you are training for maximal strength, you should prioritize movements that have you as stable as possible that are done with movements that allow you to load up with heavier loads, whereas things like bodyweight training, kettlebells, and isolation exercises may be best for hypertrophy or endurance programs.
 Rest Periods Can Be As Long As Needed for Both Hypertrophy and Strength 

 Hypertrophy programs may have shorter rest periods than strength programs because the loading is less. 

 However research suggests that longer rest periods for hypertrophy programs may actually be more effective at allowing individuals to push to fatigue and increase muscle size, as shorter rest periods may not allow them to push as hard.   They will feel tired, but the muscle may not be trained as hard directly. 

 Generally speaking, rest periods should take as long as it is needed for the lifter to push as hard as they need to on the work set ( with the one exception listed above ). If they can not perform as well as prior sets, this is often due to not resting enough between sets ( you will have some fatigue that sets in, however this drop off should not be drastic ). 
 Who Should Do Hypertrophy? 
 strength athletes can benefit from performing a hypertrophy training program 

 Hypertrophy training goes hand in hand with strength training, and is a necessary prerequisite for optimal strength development and injury prevention. 

 Generally speaking, lifters who are concerned with gaining size and muscle mass, and who are less concerned with maximal strength developed during their current training block can focus more on hypertrophy training. 

 They will still build foundational strength, and will be in a good position to transition to a more strength focused training program following a few months of hypertrophy training. 

 Strength athletes can benefit from performing a hypertrophy training program as a period where they can build more muscle, decrease stress and loading on the body, and help their body recover from prior high intensity training programs. 

 This temporary shift in training focus could also lend itself to long term progress in strength development as well. 
 Who Should Do Strength? 

 As stated above, strength and hypertrophy go hand in hand and are critical phases of training for all lifters. 

 For lifters who are concerned with peak strength, whether for athletic reasons or competitions, then they need to train with heavier loads to have the nervous system adapt to heavier loads. 

 Strength - based lifters should however take a temporary break from lifting heavy loads every few months and enter a more hypertrophy focused training program to allow for more muscle tissue to be built and recovery of the nervous system and connective tissues to recover. 

 For lifters who generally do not lift heavy, entering a strength train program is a great way to add muscle and elevate your strength so that when you return to a more hypertrophy based training you will be able to continually progress, as at some point you will need to lift heavier to gain more muscle. 



 FAQ : Hypertrophy vs Strength 
 Does Hypertrophy Also Increase Strength? 

 For beginners and intermediate lifters, training hypertrophy will often increase strength, however in more advanced lifters a more strength focused training phase done after a hypertrophy phase is recommended if peak strength is the goal. 
 Does Hypertrophy Make You Bigger? 

 Generally speaking, hypertrophy training increases muscle size. While it can also increase strength, muscle hypertrophy increases the size of muscle fibers, as well as increases the amount of fluid pushing into the muscle to provide energy, referred to as sarcoplasmic hypertrophy ( generally done using higher rep ranges and less loading ). 
 Do You Need To Lift Heavy For Hypertrophy? 

 No, you do not need to lift as heavy to gain muscle. Hypertrophy can be trained with loads between 5 - 30 reps, however muscle failure is a key factor. For best results, experiment with the 5 - 10 rep range, 10 - 20 rep range, and 20 - 30 rep range to see which offers you the best stimulus to the muscle. 









 Hypertrophy vs. Strength training : A Complete Comparison 

 Weight training is one of the most important types of exercise you can do for your body. Whether you use free weights, bands, medicine balls, or simply perform bodyweight exercises, training your muscles to become stronger is beneficial for everyone – not just bodybuilders who are trying to build a competition - ready physique. 

 Research shows that resistance training is associated with better cardiovascular fitness, resistance to injury and back pain, and reduced risk of diabetes and heart disease. Even a 20 minute session with dumbbells or circuit machines is enough to provide you with many of the health benefits of weight training. 

 When it comes to training your muscles, there are two broad varieties : strength training and hypertrophy training. Strength training refers to the type of lifts focused on improving strength. Hypertrophy training refers to growth of muscle cells because of exercise. It is important to note that these kinds of workouts are not mutually exclusive – many lifters will mix in hypertrophy workouts along with their normal strength training routine, both as a new challenge and as a way to ensure their muscles do not get used to their normal routine. 

 However, at some point it is typically beneficial to decide if you want to focus on muscular strength or muscle size. This article will go over these two ideas, what they typically entail, and provide some recommendations on which type of weight training may be best for your personal goals. 

 What is strength training? 

 As the name implies, a strength training program is one that is designed to increase your strength, or the amount of force your muscles can exert. Unlike workout routines that are designed primarily to add muscle mass, strength training focuses on improving your ability to push, pull, squeeze, lift, squat and jump among other movements of the body. Some who participate in strength training focus on one or two specific types of lifts, such as Olympic powerlifters who compete in events to see how much they can deadlift or bench press. 

 To build muscle strength, you must perform exercises that break down your body temporarily so that more muscle fibers can be added in the " damaged " area during rest periods. Because they allow you to hit more muscle groups at once, people focusing on gaining strength typically create a program of compound lifts. Compound exercises often incorporate barbells or dumbbells and include exercises like : 

     Bench press 

     Deadlift 

     Squat 

     Military press 

 Besides the use of compound exercises, strength training is also distinct from hypertrophy training because of the way lifts are programmed. Strength training usually involves heavy weights with a lower training volume. This typically means you will perform a smaller number of sets, but your lifts will be higher intensity since you will be using heavier weight. 

 Also, as mentioned above, strength training focuses more on compound lifts that recruit bigger muscles as well as smaller tendons and ligaments. For example, bench press is a staple of many strength training programs, since it utilizes almost every upper body muscle including your chest, triceps, forearms, and others. 
 What is muscle hypertrophy training? 

 While both hypertrophy and strength training will involve performing many of the same exercises with the same kind of equipment, the goal of hypertrophy training is a little different. When your focus is on building the muscle tissue to be as large as possible, you will want to use a higher rep range with lighter weights. Also, hypertrophy training emphasizes isolation exercises that use only one or two muscles at a time. 

 Some common exercises you would see on a plan focused on hypertrophy include : 

     Bicep curls 

     Quadriceps extensions 

     Dumbbell flies 

 Hypertrophy - style training is popular in the bodybuilding community, where there is often a need to focus on muscle growth in very specific areas to ensure the physique as a whole is ready for competition. Sets performed in these kinds of training sessions will also have high reps when compared to the kind of lower rep, compound lift training that helps cause strength gains. 

 Because this type of training requires lighter weight but more reps and sets, it may take longer than a traditional strength training workout. You may also have to perform a variety of   different types of moves than you would on a plan focused on maximizing strength gains. A strength training workout with a barbell might call for only three or four different lifts, while a hypertrophy plan may require six or more. Scientific research indicates that certain kinds of exercises can induce hypertrophy in the muscles without a corresponding increase in strength. 

 Which method is right for me? 

 Although these training methods are different, neither is inherently better than the other. Many athletes incorporate both techniques at different times, as their goals may change throughout the year. Here are a few tips for deciding on whether your routine should be primarily based on gaining strength or building muscle: 

     If you 're participating in athletic competitions, you may want to focus on a specific type of strength training. For example, soccer players might want to create a weightlifting program that helps them get stronger in their lower body. 

     If you want to focus on getting bigger in a specific area, such as your shoulders or chest, you might want to create a lifting plan that helps you add skeletal muscle mass in these areas through hypertrophy. 

     If you are new to lifting, you may want to start out with a focus on compound strength training exercises. Beginners have a tendency to add muscle quickly regardless of what kind of lifts they do, and you may start out reaping more benefits from compound exercises that use multiple muscles. You can always switch to a training goal that is more focused on adding mass once you gain more experience. 

 Again, there is no reason you have to choose one or the other permanently. Many people mix it up. On certain days they perform exercises with a limited range of motion that focus on activation of specific muscle groups.   days, they will perform compound movements like lunges, deadlifts and pull - ups as a way to hit many different muscle groups at the same time. However you will still want to choose one main goal so that you know where to focus the majority of your efforts. 
 Final thoughts on choosing between hypertrophy vs. strength training 

 At the end of the day, both types of training are designed to use the principle of progressive overload on the nervous system to break down muscle fibers so they can be rebuilt stronger, in a larger quantity. Whether you want to focus on muscle building so that you can gain size, or you 'd rather improve functional, short - burst strength by focusing on training fast - twitch muscles, performing some kind of resistance training is important for your health. The CDC recommends performing muscle - strengthening activities that work all major muscle groups at least two days per week. 

 Whichever route you decide, by creating a routine that works for your specific needs, staying consistent over the long - term, and providing your body with adequate rest and nutrition, you can change your body and achieve your strength goals. 













 Fast Facts 

     Strength training and hypertrophy training are two different regimens that yield different physical results. 
     Strength training increases muscle strength, while hypertrophy training increases muscle size. 
     The best choice between hypertrophy versus strength training comes down to your personal goals and level of experience. 

 Muscle strength and muscle size are definitely related. When you ’re new to lifting weights, nearly any rep and set regimen will help you get stronger and bigger. 

 But as you become a seasoned lifter, your results will begin to slow. What once worked ( everything ) is not helping you pack on mass or strength like it was before. 

 What then? That is where tailoring your training program specifically for strength or hypertrophy ( muscle growth ) can help. 

 What is the difference between strength versus hypertrophy training, which should you choose, and how to do it? 

 If you want to build muscle mass, strength, or both, listen up. 
 Hypertrophy Versus Strength Training 

 Strength training and hypertrophy training are two distinct styles of resistance training that each rely on different reps and sets, weights, and exercises to achieve targeted results. 

 Strength training makes muscles stronger , while hypertrophy training makes muscles bigger. Here is how. 


 What is Strength Training? 

 Strength training is the best way to optimize functional muscle performance. By training for strength, you will train your muscle is ability to produce maximal force. 

 To build strength, it is key to lift at heavier loads. To do it, drop your reps ( 2 - 6 ), and lift heavier weights ( above 85 - percent of one rep max ). By cutting the reps you will be able to focus on high - quality reps at more weight. 
 Benefits of Strength Training 

 Strength - specific training will not just maximize your overall and peak strength. Here are a few of the other benefits you can expect : 

     Increase caloric expenditure and metabolism 
     Enhance athletic performance 
     Increase functional fitness 
     Increase bone density and muscle mass 
     Build or maintain strength while training less 

 What is Hypertrophy Training? 

 If you ’re looking to visibly build muscle mass, hypertrophy training will yield the largest size gains. To enhance muscle size, it is vital to increase the overall volume ( reps and sets ) during your session. 

 To do it, increase your reps ( 8 - 12 ), and lift moderate to heavy loads ( 65 to 85 - percent of one rep max ). By dropping the weight, you will be able to squeeze in more reps per set in comparison to strength training. 
 Benefits of Hypertrophy Training 

 With hypertrophy, the aim is to achieve an aesthetic look by building bigger, bulkier muscles. However, that is not the only benefit. A well - designed hypertrophy program will also : 

     Increase caloric expenditure and metabolism 
     Increase muscular symmetry and reduce strength imbalances 
     Reduce risk of injury 
     Increase strength and power 

 

 Take note : strength training increases muscle mass, and hypertrophy training can also increase strength. You ca not have one without the other. But hypertrophy outperforms strength training for optimizing muscle growth, and vice - versa. 
 Which Is Better : Strength Versus Hypertrophy Training? 

 There is no bad choice. It comes down to your goals. 

     If you want to increase the size of your muscles, hypertrophy training is for you 
     If you want to increase the strength of your muscles, consider strength training 


 Should You Try Strength or Hypertrophy Training First? 

 If you ’re a beginner, you should always do hypertrophy training first. By starting with hypertrophy early in your strength training career, you will be building both muscle and strength. 

 Take your time to develop muscle mass, learn the proper technique, and gain some confidence. When you do move on to strength training, you will have the muscle mass and technique to keep you safe when training at higher loads. 
 Key Differences Between Strength and Hypertrophy Training 

 When it comes to strength and hypertrophy training, each follows specific protocols for rep and set ranges, overall training volume, exercise selection, and nutrition. Here are the major differences. 
 Exercise Selection 

 Because the goal of strength training is max force production, your workouts should center around multi - joint compound lifts — like squats, deadlifts, bench press, and pull - ups. 

 But with hypertrophy training, you will want to use a combination of compound and isolation exercises to maximize muscle growth. Training specific muscles in isolation — like hammer curls, or leg extensions — is not great for building functional strength, but it can be helpful in stimulating specific muscle groups to grow. 

 Your exercise progression during these phases of training should vary too. Since you work with lighter weight during hypertrophy training, increasing sets and reps, load, or adding complexity to an exercise are all great ways to continue building muscle. 

 Because strength training relies on adequate overload, complexity is not your friend. Examples of complexity include alternating arms and legs, or adding a balance element to make an exercise more challenging. Often complexity takes away from your ability to produce force. Instead, focus on increasing your load or sets to progress during strength training. 









 Many, including bodybuilders, pursue muscular strength, endurance, and physique. But achieving the desired outcome has become a challenge since countless training approaches exist. As a result, many fitness enthusiasts have been left pondering which path to pursue. 

 Resistance training is one of the best ways to train your muscles to become stronger and bigger. But as you begin resistance training, you realize there are two different approaches to achieving these goals. 

 On the one hand, you have strength training focusing on raw power and maximal force production. On the other hand, you have hypertrophy training, which aims to stimulate muscle growth and sculpt a visually impressive physique. 

 The two popular workouts are intertwined methods but are different. Each approach brings its unique benefits and targets different aspects of physical performance. 

 This article dives deep into strength versus hypertrophy to understand the fundamental differences between these training methods. 

 
 What is Hypertrophy? 

 Hypertrophy is increasing or enlarging muscle fiber is size and volume resulting from targeted resistance training. It is popular among bodybuilders who focus more on increasing muscle size to achieve a visually impressive physique than strength and endurance. 

 Like any other fitness goal, acute variable training, such as selecting exercises and techniques, is crucial in achieving hypertrophy. Additionally, the number of repetitions, intensity, sets, and training frequency all create the ideal environment for hypertrophy. They determine the stress level you must put on muscles to achieve your fitness goal. 

 Hypertrophy training typically involves a high training volume of high repetitions per set, ranging from 6 to 12 repetitions at a low intensity of 75–85 % of your 1RM, and multiple sets, three to five. This rep range is commonly associated with hypertrophy because it maximizes time under tension, promoting muscle damage and metabolic stress. 

 The training is performed using lighter weights with low intensity. Therefore, it may take longer to see the result than a person doing a strength training workout. You may also need to do a wide range of movements that target specific muscle groups from various angles than strength training. 

 The hypertrophy training routine should include compound exercises such as back squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and T - bar rows to recruit multiple muscle groups simultaneously. You may also need to incorporate isolation exercises, such as bicep curls or leg extensions, to target individual muscles. 

 Benefits of Hypertrophy 

 Below are four pros of hypertrophy : 

 Increased Muscle Mass 

 While hypertrophy and strength training increases muscle size, hypertrophy allows a tremendous increase in muscle size and growth.   This is because hypertrophy enables you to train in higher volume ( do more reps and sets ) for an extended period.   The higher the training volume, the more mass increase. 

 
 Enhanced Functional Fitness and Injury Prevention 

 Although hypertrophy training is often associated with bodybuilding and aesthetics, it also has functional fitness and injury prevention benefits. As the muscles increase, they provide better support and stability to the joints. Improved structural integrity helps to prevent injuries during physical activities and sports. 

 Additionally, hypertrophy involves lifting lighter weights which often has less risk of injury when training. 
 
 Promotes Muscular Symmetry 

 Performing workouts incorrectly can cause imbalances in muscle development.   By targeting specific muscles, you can address muscle imbalances using hypertrophy workouts, which can help create a more proportionate and symmetrical physique, enhancing aesthetics and functional abilities. 

 Increase Energy Expenditure 

 One way to increase energy expenditure is by increasing your training volume ( output ). And since hypertrophy involves performing more reps, sets, and overall high training volume, it can be the best way to burn more calories while increasing muscle size. 

 
 Hypertrophy Cons 


 
 Below are four drawbacks of hypertrophy : 
 
 Reduced Strength and Power 


 While hypertrophy increases muscle size, it does not increase strength and power like strength training. Research shows that muscle mass increase due to sarcoplasmic hypertrophy does not always increase strength or force. 
 Overused Injury 

 Hypertrophy training can place substantial stress on your muscles, tendons, and joints as it involves high volume, intense workouts, and repetitive movements. 

 Also, the training has short resting time. Without sufficient muscle recovery time between sessions, the body may be unable to repair and adapt, increasing the risk of overuse injuries. 


 Focus on Aesthetics over Function 
 
 Compared to strength training, which emphasizes strength and endurance, hypertrophy training often strongly emphasizes aesthetics and muscle size, which may not align with everyone is fitness goals or functional needs. 
 Risk of Overtraining 

 Due to higher training volume and lack of adequate time to recover between workouts, intense hypertrophy training can push the body to its limits, increasing the risk of overtraining. 
 
 What is Strength Training? 

 While hypertrophy is focused on increasing muscle size, strength training is a type of resistance training exercise focused on increasing the ability of your muscle to produce strength and endurance. The workout mainly focuses on improving muscle strength, power, and perseverance to enhance your ability to push, pull and lift weights, among other exercises. 

 To stimulate strength gains, the muscles must be subjected to a level of resistance that exceeds what they are accustomed to. The progressively heavier weights or increased resistance apply stress to your muscles, causing microscopic damage to the muscle fibers. This damage stimulates physiological responses that force the body to adapt to the increased demands, improving strength. 

 Unlike hypertrophy, strength training usually involves lifting heavy weights with lower training volume.   This means you perform fewer sets of about 4 - 6 sets per workout but with higher intensity of 85–100 % of your single - rep weight capacity. The higher intensity often improves with strength. 

 Strength training workouts usually target large and multiple muscle groups and joints in one action to enhance overall strength. These include muscles like the chest, back, shoulders, arms, and legs. Typical exercises include squats, deadlifts, bench presses, shoulder presses, rows, lunges, and various upper - body and lower - body exercises. 
 Benefits of Strength Training 

 While strength and hypertrophy training share common benefits, strength training has some distinct advantages compared to hypertrophy - focused training. They include : 
 Increased Strength 

 Strength training programs often involve lifting heavy weights at lower repetitions, aiming to develop the neuromuscular system, improving the force production rate, and firing synchronization necessary for lifting greater loads. This focus on maximal strength can be particularly beneficial for you or athletes such as Olympic power lifters involved in sports that require explosive power. 
 Enhanced Neuromuscular Coordination 

 Strength training improves neuromuscular coordination — efficient communication and synchronization between the nervous system and muscles. By performing complex movements and progressively increasing the load, strength training enhances the nervous system is ability to recruit and activate the appropriate muscle fibers, improving coordination and motor skills. 

 
 Joint Stability and Injury Prevention 

 Strength training targets the muscles surrounding and supporting the joints. This increases stability and reduces the risk of injuries like sprains, strains, and instability. 
 Cons of Strength Training 

 Despite strength training having pros, it also has its cons. They include : 
 Increased Risk of Injury 

 Strength training involves lifting heavy weights and performing complex movements under high intensity.   This can increase the risk of injury if proper form, technique, and safety precautions are not followed. 

 
 Neural Fatigue 
 

 Neural fatigue refers to a decrease in the ability of the nervous system to recruit and activate muscle fibers efficiently, resulting in a reduction in strength and performance. 

 Lifting heavy weights at high intensity, as in strength training, places significant stress on the nervous system, leading to neural fatigue, especially when training sessions are frequent without adequate recovery periods. 


 Hypertrophy Vs. Strength Training Which is the Best? 
 

 Hypertrophy and strength training interconnect with each other. When you perform hypertrophy, the increased muscles can result in an improvement in strength. When you do strength training, the ability to perform workouts for long periods increases, possibly resulting in hypertrophy. 

 Although these workouts are interconnected, you can choose the one you want to focus on depending on your fitness goals. 


 Focus on hypertrophy if your fitness goal is bigger muscles and a well - defined muscular physique. The training will help you add skeletal muscle mass in targeted areas like your shoulders or chest. If you are an athlete participating in athletic performance, strength training may suit you. Create a strength training program targeting the areas you need to increase strength. 


 If you are new to lifting, the National Academy of Sports Medicine recommends building a solid foundation through compound strength training before trying hypertrophy. Besides, novices tend to develop muscle rapidly regardless of the type of lifts they do. Thus, you may begin reaping hypertrophy benefits from strength training compound exercises that use multiple muscles. Upon gaining more experience and a strong foundation, you can switch to hypertrophy training if muscle gain is your goal. 


 Also, you can mix hypertrophy and strength training exercises if you are advanced in weightlifting and want to improve strength and endurance alongside increased muscle mass. For instance, you can perform hypertrophy workouts with a constrained range of motion on certain days to activate and increase the size of specific muscle groups. On alternate days, you use strength training compound exercises like deadlifts, lunges, and press - ups to work for numerous muscle groups simultaneously. However, choosing one main goal is still important to know where to focus most of your time and energy. 

 
 Conclusion 

 
 Understanding the difference between hypertrophy and strength training approaches is essential to unlocking your full potential and achieving your fitness goals. 


 Strength training builds a foundation of power, resilience, and functional prowess. It empowers you to conquer physical challenges, excel in athletic pursuits, and develop a body capable of efficiently performing everyday activities. 

 On the other hand, hypertrophy training delves into the art of muscle growth and aesthetics. It sculpts and shapes your physique, creating visually impressive results that showcase your dedication and hard work. 


 Embrace the difference in these training approaches by diving into the world of strength and hypertrophy. 












 Can you train to build strength and build muscle at the same time? 

 That is a question you may have wondered. If you look around, there seems to be a big gap between the physiques of those who strive to only build strength, like powerlifters, and those who only strive to build muscle, like bodybuilders. So, is it possible? 

 The simple answer is a resounding YES. 
 Strength & Hypertrophy Go Hand - In - Hand 

 Not only can you build muscle and strength at the same time, but those two things go hand - in - hand. In fact, these go hand - in - hand so much so that if you were to pick one as a goal, you would get some of the other as a byproduct. 

 What I mean by that is that if you chose strength as your main focus, you would still see muscle growth and if you chose muscle growth as your main goal, you would notice your strength increasing. There is no way to avoid this completely because the same principles used to build muscle are used to build strength and vice - versa. 

 With bigger muscles comes the possibility of more strength and with more strength comes the possibility of bigger muscles. 

 Do not believe me? Take a look at 8 Time Mr Olympia winner. Obviously, his main goal was to build muscle and have the greatest physique on the planet, yet you can find videos of him deadlifting over 800 lbs and benching almost 500 lbs. 


 The Correlation Between Size & Strength 

 Why is there such a correlation between size and strength? 

 One reason is that because when you increase the size of the muscle fibers, there is more potential for them to handle the heavier weight, as there is simply more fibers to be recruited to handle the load. This just makes sense, as we typically associate bigger with stronger. 

 In line with that, greater strength means a greater ability to handle a heavier load, which should allow you to handle more volume than someone with less strength. Volume ( weight x sets x reps ) has been shown time and time again to be the driving force for size ( and strength ). So, if you can handle more weight, theoretically you have potential to build more muscle than someone weaker. 
 Training For Both 

 Here is an example : Imagine someone with a one rep max ( 1RM ) of 225 lbs ( 102 kgs ) and another person with a 1RM of 315 lbs ( 142.8 kgs ). Theoretically, the person with the 225 lb max would be able to comfortably do sets of 10 reps with around 150 lbs ( 68 kgs ) while the person with the 315 lb max would be able to comfortably do sets of 10 with 205 lbs ( 93 kgs ). Who do you think would build more muscle over time? Obviously, the person lifting the heavier load would be able to do more volume and would be more likely to experience greater muscle growth as a result. 

 Because of these things, I would say that it is not only possible to train for hypertrophy and strength but that everyone looking for either should train for both, at least to a degree. Since the two are not mutually exclusive, it is of great benefit to draw from muscle building and strength building practices. So, if you are trying to build pure strength, you should be looking to learn some things from bodybuilders. If you are trying to build massive muscles, you should be looking to learn some things from powerlifters. 

 A simple way to get the most out of your training for strength and hypertrophy is to vary the rep ranges you use in a week. Utilize lower rep ranges with heavier weights as well as more moderate loads with higher reps. This will help you get the advantages of both. Of course, you can favor one or the other more depending on your goals, but the variation will definitely leave you better off than just doing sets of 10 - 12 for hypertrophy or sets of 3 - 5 for strength every day, each week. 


 Take - Home Message 

 So, to recap, training for strength and hypertrophy is not only possible but unavoidable to a degree but definitely recommended. By training for both in a week, you will allow yourself to get the benefits of both, which will help you whether you are looking to primarily build muscle or gain strength. 










 Hypertrophy training is when you train in a manner that promotes muscle growth ( hypertrophy ). 


 While there are various ways to do this, the goal is the same : to increase muscle mass ( which may not be directly in line with increasing strength ). 


 Hypertrophy Training vs Strength Training 


 For most individuals ( beginners and intermediate lifters ) doing a set of 10 back squats will both build muscle and general strength. The key difference between the terms comes when you really define “ strength ” training. 


 For some, this means just being able to lift relatively heavy weights. For others, training strength means training MAXIMAL strength, which is much more nervous system dependent than general hypertrophy training. 


 For this reason, most training that occurs under the 5 rep threshold is often seen as “ strength training ” due to the increased relative loading ( closer to one is true maximum ). 


 Below, we will discuss various rep ranges for training hypertrophy, maximal strength, and general strength and muscle building : all of which are often accomplished in beginner training, but must be specifically attacked at more advanced levels. 


 Rep Ranges For Hypertrophy 


 When you are on a mission to develop bigger muscles and create more raw material to then transition into heavier strength training, it is important to understand the various repetitions ranges that have been seen to promote muscle growth ( which is not the same as maximal strength ). 


 It is also important to understand that a lifter can get “ stronger ” without actually increasing muscle hypertrophy ( size and growth ), which often occurs early in a beginner is workout journey. 


 This is primarily due to increased muscle coordination and nervous system adaptations. 


 For this reason, many lifters will often train TOO heavy while attempting to maximize muscle growth. 


 For years, gym goers have been programmed to train 8 - 12 reps for muscle growth and strength. 


 While these are great recommendations for beginners ( and often where many people who are new to training SHOULD do ), these are general guidelines and do not apply as one begins to progress. 


 MUSCLE HYPERTROPHY 


 When training muscle hypertrophy, various muscle groups can respond to rep ranges differently based on generics, muscle fiber types, and the individual. 


  For example, individuals with more slow twitch quad muscles may have better muscle growth training in the 12 - 20 rep range, whereas lifters who have more fast twitch muscle may just feel beat up training that high of reps ( and do not get delayed onset muscle soreness ). In those individuals, training a lower rep range of 8 - 12 might suffice. 


 For most individuals, it is key to experiment within the 8 - 15 rep range, and then work yourself either up to say 15 - 25 reps ( with hard exertion ), and see what happens. Conversely, training with 5 - 10 reps can also be a good way for some individuals to pack on serious muscle mass. It is recommended however, that training less than 5 reps be reserved for more strength focused training. 


   HYPERTROPHY 


 This is a range that can be good for lifters who adapt better ( and get a good muscle pump and soreness ) using heavier loads and 5 - 10 reps per set. This is also a good in - between range for lifters who want to progress into a more strength - focused training phase, yet spent some time training in the 8 - 15, or 15 - 25 rep range. 


 How To Determine Which Rep Range Is Best For YOU? 


 This can be a challenging question for many lifters, especially when a friend has success doing one thing, yet that same exercise and rep range just makes your joints hurt. 


 Below are three training outcomes that you should look for when training for muscle growth. If a movement, rep range, and workout provides all three of these, it is generally said that those movements and reps work well for your body and make - up. 


 1 – DO YOUR MUSCLES FEEL PUMPED UP DURING THE WORKOUT / SETS? 


 This is instant feedback, and you need to focus on this during a set. If you can not feel the muscle working, and feel the local muscle fatigue ( like a muscle burn or exhaustion ), then you either need to lighten the load and focus on the movement, go slower and feel the muscle stretch, and use a fuller range of motion ( or better yet, do all three ). 


 2 – DO YOU HAVE MUSCLE SORENESS A DAY OR TWO AFTER THE WORKOUT? 


 Delayed onset muscle soreness is a key indicator of a good muscle hypertrophy session. That said, muscle soreness is NOT ALWAYS indicative of an effective training session, however some slight soreness can be a good sign of muscle stress that will then promote hypertrophy. It is also important to note that soreness that impedes your ability to train in following workouts, or one is that impair your day to day life ( like an overly aggressive workout that creates severe leg soreness ) is a good indicator that you were on the right track, you just did too much volume ( too many sets ) or trained too hard for that session. 


 3 – ARE YOUR JOINTS PAIN FREE WHEN DOING THE MOVEMENTS? 


 If at any point during or after a training session you have joint pain and/or discomfort, which is different from sore muscles, this is an indicator that you are causing too much stress and damage to bones, ligaments, and tendons. This can be caused by many things, however the most common is ( 1 ) improper training techniques, ( 2 ) too heavy of loads, ( 3 ) lack of control in a movement.. slow down, and/or ( 4 ) injury. If you are injured or feel injured, it is best to back off from the movement that causes pain, rest, and determine if you need to see a medical profession. If pain goes away, try performing other exercises for the same muscle group as sometimes a movement might not work well for you, despite it doing well for someone else. 

 Looking for a workout program?  The workouts will adapt automatically to your levels of recovery and rate of progress. With over 600 movements and exercises videos, you can be sure to perform the movements correctly for optimal results. Take the guesswork out of your workouts.  
 Add Hypertrophy Training Into A Strength Program 



  


 Below are four areas where you can add hypertrophy training into a strength program. It is recommended to train your strength lifts first, when you are fresh, and then transition into hypertrophy training with emphasis on the key markers above rather than how heavy you are lifting. 


 UNILATERAL EXERCISES 


 Unilateral exercises are a great way to increase muscle activation, hypertrophy, and address any muscle imbalances. Movements like lunges, split squats, single arm presses, and single leg hip raises are all good options to choose from. Training these with emphasis on coordination, proper technique and joint mechanics, and feeling the muscle should be of the higher priority. 


 SINGLE JOINT MOVEMENTS 


 Movements like hamstring curls ( only joint moving is the knee ), triceps extensions ( only joint moving is the elbow ), and chest fly ( only joint moving is the shoulder ) are all examples of single joint exercises. These are great to address specific weaknesses or highly areas that you may want to grow more muscle mass. It is not recommended to train these movements with lower rep ranges, so aim to perform 8 - 15 reps on most of these movements, or more. 


 MACHINE - BASED LIFTS 


 Similar to single joint and unilateral movements, machines are a great way to increase muscle mass without having to place additional stress on supportive muscle groups. While that is generally a benefit for overall fitness, training in an isolated manner after compound strength lifts can help target a muscle group without weaker supportive muscles holding you back. Let is say for example, you want to grow your quadriceps more, so you attack 4 sets of squats for strength. Afterwards, you could train higher rep back squats, however you may find your lower back fatigues out or you simply feel drained. Instead, performing machine hack squats may be a solid option as it can take pressure off your lower back and allow you to isolate the quads more and provide more stimulus for growth. 


 LIGHT COMPOUND LIFTS 


 You can train compound movements, often ones you do for strength, for muscle hypertrophy as well. Just be aware that some movements, like high rep deadlifts, will create higher amounts of systemic ( and nervous system ) fatigue, and may not be the best option for muscle hypertrophy of the hamstrings due to the overall stress it promotes. Instead, you could train deadlifts for strength, and then move to a less stressful exercise like barbell good mornings to specifically target the hamstrings. 



 Below are four tips to help you maximize muscle hypertrophy and aid in overall strength development. 


 1 – MONITOR TRAINING VOLUME 


 Your accessory hypertrophy training should be done in a way that supports your strength lifts. If you find you are beating yourself up from accessory exercise that causes more fatigue ( you are not recovering from workouts ), and/or your strength is not going up, you may be performing too much training volume. You can refer to this hypertrophy training guidelines central hub for more specific recommendations of optimal training volume for muscle growth. 


 2 – UNDERSTAND YOUR REP RANGES 


 Be sure to refer to the rep range guidelines from earlier in this article. These guidelines will help you navigate your accessory training programs, and help you better individualize your own muscle growth goals based on how your body reacts to various rep ranges. 


 3 – UNDERSTAND POSITIVE MARKERS FOR MUSCLE GROWTH 


 When training for muscle hypertrophy, it is key to not focus on HOW MUCH WEIGHT YOU ARE LIFTING, but rather how your body responds to the stress of a training session. Use the 3 training outcomes from above to help guide you along your muscle building journey. If you find you are failing to accomplish all three objectives, then you need to reevaluate your rep ranges, overall training load ( doing too much OR not enough ), technique, range of motion ( fuller is better ), tempo of movements ( slow and controlled on lowering phases ), and exercise selection. 


 4 – KNOW WHEN TO BACK OFF 


 Your hypertrophy training should support your strength goals. If you find that your hypertrophy training is ( 1 ) creating excessive soreness that impedes your strength training, ( 2 ) resulting in joint pain and/or connective tissue issues, or ( 3 ) general lack of recovery ; it is best to back off slightly and do one or two less sets per movement and see if that helps your body recover over a span of a couple weeks. 


 Final Notes 


 When training for muscle hypertrophy, be sure to always monitor overall training volume so that you can maximize muscle growth, allow for recovery, and still train strength. Adding too much can certainly be counterproductive, but by following the tips above you should be able to navigate those waters. Lastly, it is also important to note that you can dedicate certain training phases ( 6 - 12 weeks in length ) to more hypertrophy - focused training, with the strength movements being there to maintain while you push harder on gaining muscle mass. This is often done, and then transitioned into a more strength - focused period. 










 Maximize Both 

 Can you get 100 % of the maximum hypertrophy possible while also getting 100 % of the maximum strength possible, in short no. There is a reason the top bodybuilders are more jacked than the top powerlifters. It is not just body fat percentage differences. 

 There is a reason powerlifters are stronger than bodybuilders ( when it comes to 1RMs ). Maximizing the amount of muscle on your frame is different to having a lot of muscle while trying to be as strong as possible. 

 This is especially important the more advanced you become. For a completely untrained person there is very little difference between training for maximal strength and maximal hypertrophy. The more advanced you get the more this diverges. 

 There is always a trade off for being the best at something. This does not just apply to lifting. Decathletes are not world record holders in any individual event. 

 You only have limited resources, the specific training required to be the best at one thing takes a massive amount of time, energy and recovery resources. This means that unless the other thing you ’re trying to be the best at is very similar there will not be enough carryover to be near your potential at both. 

 100 m and 200 m sprint is a good example. However this was also only possible due to how much of a genetic freak he was. If he had only focused on one of them he would have still have been better at that one than when he was training both of them. 

 You can be world class at one thing and good at many others. You will not be world class in several things due to the nature of what it takes to be world class. 

 Diminishing Returns 

 It is better to think of strength and hypertrophy as a spectrum, if you maximize strength you ca not maximize hypertrophy and vice versa. Where in this spectrum your training puts you will determine how strong you are relative to your size. 

 As stated above you will not be able to get as strong and muscular as possible at the same time, but you can be pretty close to both. This is a difference that will not matter much unless you ’re trying to compete against others at an elite level. 

 This is due to diminishing returns. you have probably heard of the Pareto principle. If not it means that roughly 80 % of the results come from putting in 20 % of the effort. It does not necessarily apply in all cases with those specific percentages but the principle stands well. There is definitely diminishing returns. When you get past a low baseline each unit of effort leads to smaller and smaller increases in results. 

 Putting numbers to this if 50 units of effort gets you 100 units of results. 

 100 units of effort may only get you 125 units of results. So a 100 % increase in effort only led to a 25 % increase in results. Do not get attached to the specific numbers, the principle is what is worth noting. 

 How does this apply to combining both? Lets say you have 100 units of effort to give. If you purely prioritize one this may give you 100 units of results in that one and 60 in the other ( as there is carryover between both ) leading to 160 total units. 

 If you give 50 units of effort to both this may give you 90 units of results in both ( carryover ) leading to 180 total units of results. 

 Trying to balance both would give slightly worse results to either one individually, but better results overall. This is what a lot of lifters who do not compete would like ( including me ). 

 It does not even have to be 50 - 50. If you care about one more it is useful to know how to combine both. 

 THIS IS ALL RELATIVE TO YOUR GENETICS. You may try to get as jacked as possible and put everything into it. Maximize the effectiveness of your training, diet, sleep, stress management etc over a ten year period. Genetic freaks exist and can put in less effort for half the time and get better results. 

 This is an unfortunate reality but largely irrelevant unless you ’re competing in something. All you can focus on is getting the best out of yourself, if you have done that there is nothing more you could have done so why worry? 

 Differences Between Strength and Hypertrophy Training 

 This is a good video on the differences between both, I ’m a fan of R is work. I remember listening to this 2 - 3 months ago. There is going to be similarities between what I have wrote here and what is covered in the video. 

 There is not much new information coming out in the fitness industry, most things have been said before. Often “ new information ” is just old information put into someone else is words. 

 However the section at the end of this article explains in detail how to design training for strength and hypertrophy at the same time. I have not seen much on this before so it will be very useful to you if that is something you ’re interested in. 

 Exercise Selection Differences 

 Exercise selection varies depending on whether you ’re training primarily for strength or size. When you ’re training for strength you HAVE to do specific exercises. 

 Whether they ’re exercises necessary for the sport you compete in. Such as the straight bar back squat, flat barbell bench press and conventional / sumo deadlift in powerlifting. Or just lifts that are a good benchmark of general strength capabilities even if they are not part of a sport you compete in. These may include weighted pull ups, weighted dips and front squats. 

  They may easily irritate connective tissue and not stimulate the muscle well for the amount of fatigue they cause. 

 Because these lifts are used as benchmarks, to get the most out of them you will have to train them. This allows you to get the skill of the lift down to see where your actual strength lies. You may have to incorporate certain lifts that are not an efficient use of your time / recovery resources. 

 For hypertrophy there are no MANDATORY lifts. There are at least several different exercise variations and often many movement patterns that can be used to stimulate every part of each muscle. You can select exercises that seem to give you the most stimulus for the least fatigue so you can stimulate as much as possible while limiting fatigue build up. 

 Hypertrophy focused programs will usually include more machine based and isolation single joint lifts that use less muscle groups. 

     More of a focus in hypertrophy training than in strength training. 

 Strength focused programs will usually include more free weight / bodyweight exercises and multi joint compound movements that allow for more free movement, unlike machines. 

 Hybrid strength and hypertrophy programs will be somewhere in between depending on which you are prioritizing. 

 RPE Differences 

 As you get more advanced sets need to be taken to a relatively high RPE to be effective for muscle growth. Sets below RPE 6/6.5 or so are not very effective for stimulating hypertrophy. 

 Not that they ’re ineffective. They ’re just not a very efficient. Your time and energy would be better spent at a slightly higher RPE if your goal is just hypertrophy. 

 There is a minimum intensity ( % 1RM ) to stimulate noticeable strength gains but it is not that high. 75 % is usually considered the lower bound, 80 % is definitely heavy enough to stimulate strength well. 

 You could do several singles at 80 %, get a good strength stimulus and still have the hardest single still be far below RPE 6. This would be a good way to stimulate strength without stimulating much hypertrophy. 

 However it is very rare for someone to want to maximize strength while seeking absolutely 0 hypertrophy. This rarely occurs unless someone competes in a strength sport and has maxed out their weight class. Most people want a combination of strength and muscle mass. 

 Including some lower RPE strength work ( to maximize technical proficiency under heavy loads and train the nervous system ) and also some higher RPE hypertrophy work is a good way to accomplish both. 

 The ratio of which can be determined by how important each aspect is to you. 

 Training Frequency Differences 

 There are 2 different types of training frequency to consider, frequency of training each muscle group and how many days you train per week. 

 Hypertrophy training is more suited to a higher number of training days per week. It is not uncommon for bodybuilders to train 6 days a week. Sometimes this includes 2 sessions per day. 

 It is very rare for powerlifters to train 6 days per week, 5 is usually the highest you will see. Strength training is a lot more neurologically taxing due to the heavier loads lifted. Even when the volume used is not very high it is not possible for most people to get amped up to lift very heavy more than 5 days a week. 

     I highly doubt he trains hard 6 days a week 

 Your joint and connective tissue integrity is another variable that has to be considered. Maximal strength training requires you to practice specific lifts, this practice also needs to be heavy. This means you need to repeat the same movement patterns relatively frequently with heavy loads. This makes it pretty easy to irritate connective tissue if you ’re not careful with the rest of your programming. Bodybuilding training can use a wider variety of exercises at lighter loads which is more joint friendly. 

 Training frequency per muscle group is quite variable for both. Especially if we consider technically focused sessions, these are often included in strength programs to improve technical efficiency. 

 When discussing overloading sessions for both you can train more frequently for hypertrophy than for strength. This is because for hypertrophy training the muscle just needs to be at least close to fully recovered to overload again. 

 For strength all of the muscles, connective tissue and nervous system need to be close to fully recovered. The muscular system recovers the fastest out of these. Overloading strength sessions ca not take place as frequently as overloading hypertrophy sessions. 

 You have to maximise proficiency with a single lift when it comes to strength, this is not true to the same extent for hypertrophy. This means you can utilise a larger degree of exercise variation for hypertrophy which also allows you to train more frequently. 

 A good way to combine both each week is to have a strength session for each lift and 1 or more hypertrophy focused sessions. These should be spread out so that you ’re as close to fully recovered as possible for the strength session. You can be slightly fatigued going into the hypertrophy sessions and still get a good hypertrophy stimulus. 

 Progression Differences 

 Progression for strength and for hypertrophy is similar but not exactly the same. You will want to increase performance over time for both ( progressive overload ) but this will manifest in slightly different ways for each. 

 For strength increasing load is better than increasing reps. It is definitely better than increasing sets ( volume ) which might actually be counterproductive. 

 For hypertrophy increasing load and reps are both viable tools as long as the reps do not drop too low ( below 5). Increasing sets ( volume ) throughout a mesocycle is debatable. 

 I find a good compromise to be keeping sets for main compounds static and increasing myo rep clusters on isolation lifts. This allows slight increases in volume without adding noticeable fatigue from week to week which would impair strength. 

 The best way to combine both is to have a strength based day and hypertrophy based day for each movement pattern in each training week ( microcycle ). 

 On the strength based day we prioritise load increases as long as reps do not drop too low. 

 On the hypertrophy based day we can try to increase load ( as long as reps do not drop too low ). We can also try to increase reps with the same load. 

 Myo rep clusters on isolation movements can be slightly increased every week as long as the strength based days are not affected. If not they can remain constant, or just be increased in places where there is enough recovery time after to not affect the strength work. 

 Loading and Rep Range Differences 

 Hypertrophy is pretty similar when taken to failure in all rep ranges across the 5 - 30 rep range. This does not mean that sets under 5 reps do not stimulate hypertrophy, they absolutely do. Just that as the reps get lower below 5 the sets become less stimulative on a per set basis. 

     Squat singles are not the best for hypertrophy 

 Trying to get compound exercise volume from purely sets of 5 and below would be great for strength but poor for hypertrophy. On a pure set for set basis they would be less stimulative. You ’d also be able to do less sets as you ca not handle as much heavy volume as moderate volume. 

 When lifting very heavy there is also the risk of altering your technique slightly to be able to move more load. The target muscle would be stimulated even less. 

 Strength is not technically tied to a rep range. It is purely based on how heavy you ’re lifting relative to your one rep max ( 1RM ). However this is manifested in the rep ranges that you use. The lower the reps the heavier you can lift. Your strength base will be built most effectively with sets of around 6 reps and below, however sets of 7 - 10 are still effective for strength. 

 We can combine both of these by having both a strength and hypertrophy session for each muscle group / movement pattern throughout the week. 

 The strength session can be in the 4 - 7 rep range ( mainly the lower end ), which is very good for strength and is decent enough for hypertrophy. The hypertrophy sessions can be in the 7 - 10 rep range which all very good for hypertrophy and decent enough for strength. 

 Volume Differences 

 From the research available it is generally agreed upon that we want to train with as much volume as we can recover from to maximise hypertrophy. This does not necessarily mean we NEED to increase volume throughout a mesocycle. 

 Higher volume training contributes massively to fatigue levels. So we ca not have the volume too high otherwise our top end strength will be limited by fatigue levels. We will not effectively be able to train for strength. 

 This seems like a conundrum, how do we reconcile these two seemingly contradictory conditions? 

 Diminishing returns, which we discussed at the start. If the maximal amount of hypertrophy occurs at 100 % volume, you may get 85 % hypertrophy at 65 % volume. 

 This 65 % volume will lead to noticeably less fatigue. If it is distributed intelligently over the week this will allow you to get a significant majority of the hypertrophy available. It will also minimally impact your top end strength work. This still allows you to drive your lower rep range strength up due to lower fatigue levels. 

 Designing Hybrid Strength and Hypertrophy Mesocycles 

 I recently published an article on the negatives of training with high volumes. At the end of that article I briefly gave some main considerations that you should abide by when creating hybrid strength and hypertrophy mesocycles. I will break it down in more detail here so you know how to structure your own hybrid strength and hypertrophy training. 

 Considerations 

 These are the considerations I posted in my other article linked above. 

     Volume should be moderate. 
     The week will be asymmetrical in terms of stress. 
     The heavy strength days should be at the very start of the week. 
     The middle / early end of the week should be more volume focused. 
     The end of the week should be easy to recover from so you ’re pretty fresh for the heavy days ( whether this be from easier workouts or more rest days ). 
     The volume ( set count ) in each week should be relatively constant. The exception being the end of the final week of the block. You can increase volume here since there is a deload coming up. 

 Volume 

 Volume ca not be too high or too low. Volumes that are too high come with significant amounts of fatigue that will affect your top end strength. Heavier strength based volume ( 80 - 85 % ) also tends to be more difficult to recover from than moderate volume due to the sheer loads being used. 

 If the volume is too low you simply will not have enough volume to stimulate hypertrophy at a reasonable rate if you ’re fairly advanced. 

 Recently there is been a lot of debate on whether increasing volume throughout a training mesocycle is optimal for hypertrophy. I have tried both keeping volume ( in terms of hard sets ) constant and increasing them slowly throughout a mesocycle. 

 It is hard to say if increasing volume through a mesocycle is better for hypertrophy. I have found success increasing it very slowly. It is easy to increase too fast and run yourself into the ground. I do not think your body adapts to a given volume level quickly enough to justify quicker increases in volume. 

 An increase from say 10 sets of chest to 16 throughout a training block is probably overkill and can even hold back your long term progress. 

 Rapid volume progression definitely is not the way to go with hybrid training. The fatigue from rapid set increases will absolutely hinder how much you can lift on your strength based days. 

 I find increasing myo rep clusters throughout a mesocycle for small easy to recover isolation movements to be the best way to increase volume over a mesocycle. The fatigue increase from this is minimal. It may take you from 10 sets to 11/12 throughout a mesocycle using only movements that are easy to recover from. 

 This can also be done on hybrid programs as the fatigue is minimal. The clusters could even be increased at an even slower rate such as every other week. 

 In the final week of the mesocycle, even on main compounds volume can be increased slightly in the second half of the week. This is because the strength based work has already been completed, and there is a deload coming up to drop any extra fatigue generated. 

 Asymmetrical Stress 

 You need to be relatively fresh with minimal fatigue on your strength based days. We need a certain amount of volume to drive hypertrophy, but it needs to be placed in a way that it does not disrupt your heavy days too much. 

 The goal should be increasing performance on all days from week to week. At the very least it should be increasing on your strength based days if it is holding constant ( in the short term ) on your more volume focused days. 

 Lets take an example of an upper / lower split to make things simple. 

 This could be accomplished by training heavy upper and lower on days 1 and 2 respectively. Moderate upper lower on days 4 and 5 respectively. Having days 3,6 and 7 as rest days. 

 Keeping volume ( in terms of hard sets ) the same on both days would give you an extra rest day for each muscle group before the strength days. This is fine. You can still get enough volume and intensity on the moderate days to stimulate hypertrophy. 

 With higher frequencies this can still be done, you just have to think a bit more. For example if you were training a muscle 3x a week. Such as training the pressing muscles on days 1,3 and 5, you may divide the sets roughly equally but bias days 1 and 5 a bit. 

     7 sets on days 1 and 5, 6 sets on day 3. 

     Day 1 would be the strength based day, days 3 and 5 would be more volume focused. 

     Day 3 would include movements that favor shorter muscle lengths, so that there is minimal / no soreness / muscle damage for day 5. 

     Day 5 may have movements that stress longer muscle lengths which leads to a bit more stimulation and soreness. Due to the 50 % extra recovery time you can still recover in time for next week is day 1. 

 This can be done with even higher frequencies, you just need to keep the general principles here in mind. 

 Mesocycle Design 

 I ’m going to use the example above of a 4x a week upper lower split and show how I ’d design the upper body days throughout a mesocycle. I do not want to make this article obscenely long so I will just show the upper body progression. You can 100 % get the concept from what I ’m going to show you without the lower body aspects. 

 Do not get too attached to the specific exercise variations, sets and weights used. This is a super generic training block. The idea is to just show how things progress throughout the course of a mesocycle. 

 The main points to take away are that : 

     The weights and RPE ( proximity to failure ) increase slightly every week. 
     Volume ( hard sets ) stays constant for the main compounds ( no set change from week to week barring deload ). 
     Volume increases very slowly for less fatiguing isolations in the form of myo rep clusters. This is not mandatory, they can be kept constant as well. 
     There is slight undulation throughout the week in terms of loads used. 
     There is enough variation in loading to gain the benefits of daily undulating periodisation ( DUP ). 
     Average rep range for compounds is around 7 reps per set, and is higher for isolations in the form of myo reps. 
     On the heavier days barring the deload, most of the loads used in the compounds will be in the 77.5 - 87.5 % range. This is great for strength. 
     The reps are also high enough to be effective per set for hypertrophy ( there are not many sets below 5 reps ). 
     The isolations in the form of myo reps are light enough to ensure you ’re still targeting the correct muscles ( would be hard to do lateral raises and target the side delts with sets of 6 ). 
     On the strength based days the myos are just heavy enough to get a small strength stimulus ( thought that is not the main purpose of isolation lifts ). They ’re still in an appropriate rep range for hypertrophy. 
     On the strength days when doing multiple sets not every sets has to be in the RPE range. Early sets can be slightly below the target RPE to accumulate less fatigue. The final set should always be in the range to ensure you ’re not too far from failure. 

 Conclusion 

 As long as you take into consideration the information in this article you can program for strength and hypertrophy at the same time. You will not 100 % optimise either but will get the best of both worlds, which I believe is what plenty of lifters actually want. I find it to be a more enjoyable way to train as well. 











 Conventional wisdom suggests that your pathway to success in the gym is narrow and linear. If you want to get strong, you have to train for strength. Want to build muscle? Hypertrophy has to be your only priority. 

 While this may be more true than false, especially the higher you climb on your fitness journey, the reality is not as black - and - white. Powerlifters could learn a thing or two from their posing - trunk - clad colleagues, and bodybuilders should not shy away from strength.

 If you want to enjoy the best of both worlds, you will need a handy guide to light your way. Here is how to mix powerlifting with bodybuilding and actually pull it off. 
 Combining Powerlifting and Bodybuilding 

 Like most types of program design, there is more than one way to skin the cat. If you want to mold your powerlifting workouts to accommodate some pump work, or want to bodybuild while also getting stronger, your best bet is to develop an understanding of the principles at play. 

  
 Do : Decide Your Priority 

 Combining the two sports does not necessarily mean doubling your workload or performing both in equal measure. 

 Instead, you should clearly define which of the two will be your “ primary ” focus. Decide whether you want to supplement your powerlifting training with bodybuilding, or vice versa, and proceed accordingly. 
 Do not : Stretch Yourself Thin 

 Once you have figured out which of the two will be your main focus, remember to program accordingly. If you attempt to cover all the bases in either sport or run two full routines in tandem, you might stretch or overwork yourself. 

 Mixing two styles of training is all about managing your volume, effort, and expectations equally. 
 Do : Utilize Different Equipment 

 Mixing up your training is the perfect time to dabble in different equipment. If you ’re primarily a powerlifter who wants to add some physique work to your training, you have a prime opportunity to utilize dumbbells, kettlebells, or cables during your accessory exercises. 

 Conversely, if you bodybuild, training like a powerlifter will help acclimate you to the rigors of heavy barbell training in a way you may not already be familiar with. 
 Do not : Stray Too Far From the Barbell 

 No matter how you ’re going to organize your combined training, remember to include the barbell in at least some portion of your weekly regime. 

 Barbell work can serve as the bridge between powerlifting and bodybuilding. For powerlifters, it is a necessary facet of the sport. For bodybuilders, barbell training is often the bedrock of both classic and modern muscle - building routines. 
 Do : Continue to Compete 

 You should continue to compete in powerlifting even if you ’re mixing in some bodybuilding work. Regular competitions, even if you “ train through ” them ( as in, not specifically peaking for a performance on the day ), keep you in tune with the atmosphere of a powerlifting meet. 

 On the other hand, a bodybuilder may not be able to properly prep for a show while training like a powerlifter, especially if they are not dieting down. However, there is no mandate that you show up at every physique competition peeled to the bone. 
 Do not : Have Unrealistic Expectations 

 Whether you choose to compete while mixing modalities, you should keep your expectations in check. Most athletes, whether they train for strength or size, will perform at their best if they focus squarely on one or two specific goals. 

 As such, you should not necessarily expect to hit a lifetime personal record in the squat if a third of your training involves isolated hypertrophy work. 
 Do : Focus on Nutrition 

 Diversifying your training is no excuse to let yourself be lazy about nutrition. Powerlifters need to stay on top of their intake if they want to make a specific weight class. Bodybuilders must track their nutrition to cut down for a show or bulk up in the off - season. 

 Therefore, it is just as important to be mindful of your eating habits even if you are not specifically working towards a weight or body composition - related goal. 
 Do not : Aim for Perfection 

 It is essential that you not get in your own way when you combine powerlifting and bodybuilding. While you may be able to make significant gains after you acclimate to your new program, things will likely feel a bit rocky in the beginning. 

 As long as you ’re enjoying your workouts, the gains will follow. 
 Do : Periodize Your Training 

 Although powerlifters and bodybuilders have different approaches to structuring their training, both rely on some form of periodization. If you decide to add one to the other, you should still periodize your workouts to ensure that your training is structured and productive.

 Haphazardly throwing bodybuilding work into your routine is a good way to run into a plateau or induce unwanted levels of fatigue. 
 Do not : Try to Peak 

 It may seem obvious, but you should not try to peak if you ’re mixing bodybuilding into your powerlifting training or vice - versa. 

 A powerlifter who is going heavy on accessory work may have too much fatigue accumulated from bodybuilding work to properly peak for heavy single - rep sets. 

 Similarly, too much heavy barbell work could make you too tired to effectively focus on your subsequent bodybuilding movements. 
 Sample Workouts for Combining Powerlifting and Bodybuilding 

 The hardest part of combining two different modalities is ensuring that the two styles of training work synergistically. You do not want your powerlifting work to negatively impact your bodybuilding exercises, or vice - versa. 

 Fortunately, the best way to mix the two disciplines is more straightforward than you might think. Here is a general overview : 
 Powerlifting Focus 

 Adding hypertrophy work to your powerlifting routine is easy. All you will need to do is dial back a little bit on your sport - specific training while still putting it first chronologically and philosophically. 

 For example, a “ lower body ” strength training workout with some leg hypertrophy built in might look something like this : 

     Back Squat : 5 x 3 
     Deficit Speed Pull : 6 x 2 
     Hip Thrust : 3 x 8 
     Walking Lunge : 2 x 10 steps per leg 
     Leg Extension Machine : 2 x 15 

 This kind of workout puts the most important and technical exercises at the front, ensuring that you get high - quality practice in. Afterward, you can expand your horizons with different equipment and auxiliary movements that are better suited for growing your wheels. 

 Note : If you follow a template program for powerlifting, you should be able to transplant the set - rep progression for your competition movements into a “ hybrid ” routine. Pay attention to how it affects your overall training quality and fatigue levels. 
 Bodybuilding Focus 

 Getting stronger while building your body is all about balancing your fatigue. Your training will generally look similar to that of a powerlifter who adds bodybuilding work, but your specific workouts should have a tighter focus than, say, “ pull ” or “ lower body. ” For example : 

     Rack or Block Pull : 8 x 3 
     Kroc Row : 3 x 6 
     Wide - Grip Lat Pulldown : 3 x 8, 12, 15 
     Dumbbell Pullover : 3 x 12 - 15 
     Face Pull : 2 x 15 - 20 

 This back workout will torch your lats, traps, and erectors, but it also helps you develop your deadlift lockout and general pulling power. 

 More importantly, your bodybuilding workouts should be just that — centered around building your body. The bench press, squat, and deadlift ( or their many variations ) should accompany the same body parts you ’re hitting on that day. 

 You might find it difficult to properly train your chest for mass if you started your workout with heavy back squats. 
   Methods 

 You can look beyond individual workouts and toward your overall training week if you want to combine powerlifting with bodybuilding as well. One alternative method of combination program design involves dedicating one day solely to powerlifting or strength - specific work, and then performing a physique - focused workout on a separate day. 

 For example, this two - day leg training scheme puts that idea into practice : 
 Day One ( Strength Focus ) 

     Back Squat : 5 x 5 
       Deadlift : 3 x 3 
     Good Morning : 2 x 10 
     Weighted Plank : 2 x 30 seconds 

 Day Two ( Hypertrophy Focus ) 

     Front Squat : 6 x 3 
     Romanian Deadlift : 3 x 6, 8, 12 
     Bulgarian Split Squat : 3 x 8 - 10 
     Leg Extension : 2 x 15 
     Leg Curl : 2 x 15 
     Calf Raise : 3 x 15 

 You ’re still training legs twice per week. In fact, you ’re also squatting twice to ensure high - quality skill development. The key difference being that both workouts have a distinct and clear focus, and should also “ feel ” quite different from each other. 

 The first session is par - for - the - course powerlifting, while the subsequent workout trains a variation of the competitive back squat and then hammers your legs with all manner of accessory work. 
 Benefits of Combining Powerlifting and Bodybuilding 

 You might not get as strong as a career powerlifter who only cares about their Total. In the same vein, full - time physique development is probably the best way to bulk up. 

 However, there are some unique benefits to mixing your methods and dabbling in both powerlifting and bodybuilding simultaneously. 
 Bigger Muscles Are Stronger Muscles 

 There is a synergistic relationship between muscular cross - sectional area ( which is to say, how jacked you are ) and strength potential. If you remove other factors like technical efficiency, training experience, or fatigue, a bigger muscle will be stronger than a smaller one. ( 1)(2 ) 
 Muscle Reduces Injury Risk 

 There is no foolproof way of 100 % eliminating the risk of injury in the gym. Luckily, strength training is not particularly injurious, especially when compared to ballistic exercise or contact sports. ( 3 ) 

 However, adding muscle to your frame may help reduce the risk of injury or sports - related accidents in the gym, at least partially. ( 4 ) 
 Strength Helps You Grow 

 Powerlifting is all about teaching you to push your limits. After all, you ca not casually set a new 1 - rep max. As such, the sport - specific demands of powerlifting might also help you be a better bodybuilder. 

 There is a dose and, particularly, effort - response relationship between resistance training and hypertrophy. Put simply, the longer you have been in the gym, the harder you will need to work to grow. ( 5 ) 

 High - intensity strength training will teach you to apply effort across the board, instead of sandbagging your “ smaller ” isolation exercises. 
 More Novelty to Your Workouts 

 Dedicated and focused programming is a fantastic way to hit a specific goal. On the other hand, strict periodization — whether you ’re trying to add pounds to your bar or inches to your arms — is monotonous by nature. 

 If repetitive workouts tend to make you feel bored or burnt out, mixing up your methods can remedy the issue and keep you moving forward at the same time. There is no harm in enjoying variety in the gym. 
 Your Takeaways 

 To succeed at the absolute highest levels of any athletic discipline, you will probably have to specialize. Barring that, it is both possible ( and potentially beneficial ) to combine powerlifting and bodybuilding into one comprehensive training plan. 

     Understand that you will not be able to perform both as well as if you ’d focused solely on either. 
     Keep the barbell in the limelight, but do not be afraid to experiment with non - sport - specific exercises while you can. 
     If you ’re a strength or physique athlete, it might be wise to compete casually during periods of combination training. 
     Put your strength work first during your workouts, or dedicate an entire day to it exclusively. 

 The physiological effects of combination training can benefit you whether you prefer powerlifting or bodybuilding. Bigger muscles are stronger muscles, and the musculoskeletal stimulation of bodybuilding can make you a more robust and resilient strength specialist. 
 Strength, Size, and a Whole Lot More 

 If you follow bodybuilding, you might notice a recent trend — a lot of the top athletes are not afraid to lift heavy in the gym. Many, in fact, credit max - effort training as a boon to their physique development. 

 Conversely, the modern powerlifter is not afraid to look the part. Many of the strongest athletes in the world are jacked out of their mind, and rightly so. Does this mean that they all mix training styles? Not necessarily. 

 Are successful powerlifters and bodybuilders afraid to borrow and learn from one another? Absolutely not. You ’d be wise to follow in their footsteps — your Total, and your physique, will thank you. 













 Running is one of the most popular sports in Boulder, Colorado with many individuals taking advantage of our many trail options.   In general, run workouts can focus on short duration, higher intensity sprints performed as intervals or longer duration, sustained low to moderate intensity distance runs.   Each training option promotes beneficial changes in the body but new research highlights the benefits of sprint training in aging runners. 

 Previous research has focused on the benefits of long and slow distance running, but less attention has been paid to sprint training.   In a recent review article   and colleagues discuss the beneficial adaptions of sprint training especially among aging runners ( Exercise and Sport Science Reviews 2015 ).   In comparison to endurance athletes, sprint athletes have a slower rate of decline in maximum heart rate, one of the main factors in calculating VO2 max or the maximal amount of oxygen the body can utilize each minute.   Thus sprint athletes show a smaller decline in VO2 max over time compared to their endurance training peers. 

 Sprint athletes train at higher intensities requiring faster, more explosive muscle contractions.   These contractions promote muscle hypertrophy in sprinters compared to their endurance training peers.   Thus it is not surprising sprint athletes have a slower decline in lean muscle mass due to aging compared to endurance athletes.   In addition, sprint athletes demonstrate better performance on power, agility, and jumping tasks compared to their endurance trained peers.   One final benefit of sprint training is exercise adherence.   Sprint athletes have better adherence to their exercise programs likely secondary to their workouts being less time consuming and more efficient than longer, slower endurance programs.  

 Runners are encouraged to consider implementing sprint or interval workouts into their existing endurance programs to further improve their health and performance. 









 Whether you are pounding the streets, hitting the track, or jumping on a treadmill, there is no doubt that running is one of the most popular forms of exercise. 

 According to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, around 50 million people in the US participate in some running or jogging exercise – that is 15 % of the entire population. 

 But is it the best way to lose weight? 

 You probably do not have endless time to exercise, so if weight loss is your goal, you want to know what will give you the most bang for your buck. 

 Long Distance Running 

 So, if you enjoy running and want to make this part of your exercise routine, is long - distance running or sprints best? 
 Long - distance running vs sprinting : what is the difference? 

 First, figure out the difference between long - distance running and sprints before going further. 
 What is long - distance running? 

 Many people think of long - distance running as marathons and cross - country races, which certainly counts as long - distance running, but it does not have to be long. Anything that involves running for two miles or more can be considered long - distance. 

 It requires stamina, aerobic endurance, and mental toughness. It is the chosen run for those with more time on their hands and who enjoy taking time out to reset their body and mind. 
 What is sprinting? 

 Sprinting is running flat over a short distance so that you are anaerobic and finish the exercise out of breath. It is an all - out effort designed to test your lungs to their maximum capacity. The benefits of sprinting include improvements in speed, blood pressure, and cardiovascular health. 

 This should be an exercise you can complete in under 30 seconds. The idea is that you will recover afterward and repeat several times. The recovery time between groups will depend on how fit you are, but ideally, it should give you enough time to get your breathing back to relative normality, between 1.5 and 2 minutes is ideal. 
 Long - distance running vs sprinting : which helps you lose more weight? 

 There is an argument for both disciplines, for sure. Both long - distance and sprints are exercises that will get you moving, and your body will know it is been in a workout at the end, so there is plenty to suggest that both will burn enough calories to make a marked improvement in body composition. 
 Is long - distance running good for weight loss? 

 When you think about losing weight, long - distance running is probably one of the first places your mind goes. After all, you do not see many overweight long - distance runners – so it must work. However, it is not always the most effective way to burn calories, especially considering the time it takes. 

 As a general rule, an average - sized runner will burn about 100 calories per mile. So, if you want to burn 500 calories, you need to run around 5 miles. 

 At an average pace, five miles would take around 50 minutes to run, although realistically, it would take you longer if you were new to running. So, theoretically, you could burn loads of calories and be in a calorie deficit, but only if you had lots of time to run. 

 Long - distance running is a great way to get your muscles moving at a speed that suits you, get your heart rate up and build strength and endurance. 

 If you ’re new to exercise, your body increases its sensitivity to insulin, which means you can use carbohydrates more efficiently and burn fat. This means that, to begin with, long - distance running could be an effective way to lose weight. 

 However, your body is just too damn clever ; over time, it adapts to whatever new stresses are thrown at it and the stimulus becomes more effortless. This means that eventually you will burn fewer calories over the same distance, and harder it will be to lose weight. 

 Plus, long - distance runs can leave you feeling starving afterward. The temptation to eat more sugary or high - cal foods as a treat needs to be avoided. Otherwise, you are canceling out the workout. 
 When is long - distance running good for weight loss? 

 If you are new to exercise or live a sedentary lifestyle, jogging or long - distance running is an effective way to lose weight. However, this will taper off once your body adapts, and fat and weight loss will plateau. 
 Is sprinting good for weight loss 

 Short bursts of sprinting are over so quickly that you might not realize just how great they can be for burning calories and fat. A 2019 study concluded that high - intensity sprint interval training resulted in a 28.5 % higher fat reduction. 

 You can burn up to 500 calories by running 10 x 100 - meter sprints, and the entire session will take around twenty minutes, which is perfect to incorporate into a busy schedule. 

 However, warming up is still essential. Going from zero to full speed from a cold start will put immense pressure on your joints, muscles, and heart. It is vital to take up your heart rate progressively. 

 Start with some stretches and star jumps. Make sure you ’re working your hamstrings and quads ( gently, of course- do not put massive pressure on them during the warm - up ). 
 When is Sprinting good for weight loss? 

 Sprinting is excellent for weight loss and is most likely one of the most effective exercises you can do. However, it is high - intensity and puts great stress on your body – so it is not something beginners will likely be able to do immediately. 
 Long Distance running vs. sprinting : how to get started 

 If you want to get started with long - distance running or sprints, then the best way is to progress slowly. 

 Whether you intend to concentrate on high or low - intensity workouts, you need to get your body used to what you will be asking it to do. Even if you ’re in decent enough shape, a new discipline such as running will use new muscle groups, so it is essential to ease yourself in. If you go at it too hard and fast in the early weeks, you will risk causing yourself an injury and setting yourself off - course. 

 In the first week or two, try some slow, easy runs. Keep your breathing steady throughout the run and if you feel you ’re getting out of breath, slow down or stop. Once you can comfortably run three miles, it is time to ramp things up. 

 Long - Distance Running VS Sprints : 

 At the end of each session, try eight to ten strides. These short, faster sessions aim to get your heart rate up and prepare you for more intense workouts. The aim is not to sprint “ all out ” ; you move comfortably and with speed. Strides are vital whether you intend to take sprinting or long - distance routes long - term. 

 Once you have adjusted your body to the rigors of running and it has become familiar, you will be ready to progress to the next stage. Ideally, allow three or four weeks of these long easy runs before moving to the next level. 

 If you are new to sprinting, try eight to ten sprints per session, and increase gradually as you get stronger. The key to burning calories is not the number of sets ; it is the intensity of the sprints, so that should be your primary focus. 

 As the weeks and months progress, you can increase the intensity by reducing the recovery time between reps and adding gradients, so you run slightly uphill. 

 You can perform this exercise on a treadmill or outdoors, but the latter is preferable. 

 Should you run long - distance or sprint? 

 If you are managing your calorie intake efficiently, there is no denying that you could lose weight through steady, long - distance runs. However, it can be a tricky and time - consuming process. 

 In comparison, high - intensity sprints can be performed in less time and burn more calories than slow long - distance jogs. You will also find you will not encounter the kind of sugary cravings at the end of your workout you would in the long run. The bonus is that your body will continue to burn fat even after the exercise due to your raised heart rate. 

 WINNER : High - intensity sprints are the way forward. So long as you are managing your calorie intake efficiently, you will find they are a giant stride forward in your weight loss goals. 










 Once a workout is over and you ’re back in your daily routine, your body is metabolism can continue to burn more calories then when at complete rest. This physiological effect is called excess post - exercise oxygen consumption Also known as oxygen debt, EPOC is the amount of oxygen required to restore your body to its normal, resting level of metabolic function ( called homeostasis ). It also explains how your body can continue to burn calories long after you have finished your workout. 

 Your metabolism is how your body converts the nutrients you consume in your diet to adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ), the fuel your body uses for muscular activity. ATP is produced either with oxygen using the aerobic pathways or without oxygen relying on the anaerobic pathways. When you first start to exercise, your body uses the anaerobic energy pathways and stored ATP to fuel that activity. A proper warm - up is important because it can take about five to eight minutes to be able to efficiently use aerobic metabolism to produce the ATP necessary to sustain physical activity. Once a steady - state of oxygen consumption is achieved, the aerobic energy pathways are able to provide most of the ATP needed for the workout. Exercise that places a greater demand on the anaerobic energy pathways during the workout can increase the need for oxygen after the workout, thereby enhancing the EPOC effect. 

 Here are seven things you should know about EPOC and how it can help you achieve optimal levels of calorie burning from your workouts : 
 1. During the Immediate Post - exercise Recovery Period, Oxygen is used for the Following Functions : 

     Production of ATP to replace the ATP used during the workout 
     Re - synthesis of muscle glycogen from lactate 
     Restore oxygen levels in venous blood, skeletal muscle blood and myoglobin 
     Work with protein for the repair of muscle tissue damaged during the workout 
     Restore body temperature to resting levels 

 2. Exercise that Consumes more Oxygen Burns more Calories 

 The body expends approximately 5 calories of energy ( a calorie is the amount of energy required to heat 1 liter of water 1 degree centigrade ) to consume 1 liter of oxygen. Therefore, increasing the amount of oxygen consumed both during and after a workout can increase the number of net calories burned. 
 3. Circuit training and heavy resistance training with short rest intervals require ATP from the anaerobic pathways, leading to a significant EPOC effect 

 Strength training with compound, multi - joint weightlifting exercises or doing a weightlifting circuit that alternates between upper- and lower - body movements places a greater demand on the involved muscles for ATP from the anaerobic pathways. Increased need for anaerobic ATP also creates a greater demand on the aerobic system to replenish that ATP during the rest intervals and the post - exercise recovery process. Heavy training loads or shorter recovery intervals increase the demand on the anaerobic energy pathways during exercise, which yields a greater EPOC effect during the post - exercise recovery period. 
 4. High - Intensity Interval Training ( HIIT ) is the most effective way to stimulate the EPOC effect 

 The body is most efficient at producing ATP through aerobic metabolism ; however, at higher intensities when energy is needed immediately, the anaerobic pathways can provide the necessary ATP much more quickly. This is why we can only sustain high - intensity activity for a brief period of time — we simply run out of energy. HIIT works because ATP is produced by the anaerobic pathways during high - intensity exercise ; once that ATP is exhausted, it is necessary to allow ATP to be replenished. The rest interval or active - recovery period during an anaerobic workout allows aerobic metabolism to produce and replace ATP in the involved muscles. The oxygen deficit is the difference between the volume of oxygen consumed during exercise and the amount that would be consumed if energy demands were met through only the aerobic energy pathway. 
 5. EPOC is influenced by the intensity, not the duration of exercise 

 Higher intensities require ATP from anaerobic pathways. If the ATP required to exercise at a particular intensity was not obtained aerobically, it must come from the anaerobic pathways. During EPOC, the body uses oxygen to restore muscle glycogen and rebuild muscle proteins damaged during exercise. Even after a HIIT workout is over, the body will continue to use the aerobic energy pathway to replace the ATP consumed during the workout, thus enhancing the EPOC effect. 
 6. Research has shown that resistance training can provide a greater EPOC effect than running at a steady speed 

 In an extensive review of the research literature on EPOC, study concluded that “ studies in which similar estimated energy cost or similar exercising VO2 have been used to equate continuous aerobic exercise and intermittent resistance exercise, have indicated that resistance exercise produces a greater EPOC response. ” For example, one study found that when aerobic cycling ( 40 minutes at 80 % Max HR ), circuit weight training ( 4 sets/8 exercises/15 reps at 50 % 1 - RM ) and heavy resistance exercise ( 3 sets/8 exercises at 80 - 90 % 1 - RM to exhaustion ) were compared, heavy resistance exercise produced the biggest EPOC. 
 7. The EPOC effect from a HIIT or high - intensity strength - training workout can add 6 to 15 percent of the total energy cost of the exercise session 

 High - intensity workouts require more energy from the anaerobic pathways and can generate a greater EPOC effect, leading to extended post - exercise energy expenditure. Heavy weight training and HIIT workouts appear to be superior to steady - state running or lower - intensity circuit training in creating EPOC (  , Withers and  , 2006 ). 

 Admittedly there is some debate about the significance of the EPOC effect for the average exercise participant because the high - intensity exercise required for EPOC can be extremely challenging. However, if you want results and are up for the challenge, increasing the intensity of your workouts by using heavier weights, shorter rest intervals or high - intensity cardio intervals may be worth the effort. While HIIT or heavy resistance training is effective and beneficial, remember to allow at least 48 hours of recovery time between high - intensity exercise sessions and try to limit yourself to no more than three strenuous workouts per week. If you do start increasing the intensity of your workouts to boost EPOC, consider adding these recovery strategies. 












 Distance runners from the 5k to the Marathon have no shortage of options to guide training decisions while peaking for that next big race. Many programs provide interval workouts to challenge the aerobic pathways needed to hammer a chosen race distance whether that be a 5k or full - on 26.2 marathon distance. These interval workouts are all incredibly valuable at preparing runners for grinding out the effort to hit that next PR ( personal record ), while an overlooked and undervalued training adaptation for distance runners is developing pure sprint speed. 

 Studies have proven that sprint speed is a predictor of top performance in distance running events. Sprinting improves running economy by making your top speed faster, which means that when you get faster, the pace you ran that felt hard before feels less hard. On top of that, sprint sessions are downright fun ! While running track in high school, I envied the sprinters who ran for a few seconds, and stood around for what seemed like eternity. Here, we will dive into why you should add sprinting to your training plan and give you some ways to fit sprints into your weekly mileage without sacrificing volume. 
 Why You Should Add Sprint Training Sessions 

 Sprint training can provide training benefits beyond just adding variety to your routine. As     and    , MD make clear in their book The Happy Runner, “ Running economy is influenced by biomechanics, neuromuscular circuitry, and aerobic development. ” Running economy is defined as the energy demand for a given velocity of sub - maximal running or how hard a runner has to work at a given speed below their top speed. The theoretical benefit of sprint training as a means to increase your running economy to improve distance running results is simple. Get faster at your top speed, and your speeds at less than top speed follow. Sprint training is the most efficient way to improve the biomechanics and neuromuscular circuitry for improving your top speed. If you want to run faster, you must run faster. As the Roche is also write in their book, and I can speak from my personal experience, runners tend to focus too much on aerobic development. 

 According to a study published in the International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance, researchers found significant correlations between both 5k and 10k season best times with both 100 m and 400 m sprint times. However, they found no relationship between the aforementioned race results and VO2 max There are some limitations to this study as it applies to broader populations. The study had a small sample size of 12 male athletes who were also national top - level athletes. Conversely, they also did not test any correlations of sprint speed to race distances longer than the 10k. With that, it seems entirely possible that we are not considering the adaptations that sprint training can have amongst the broad spectrum of abilities within the running community or amongst the range of racing distances popular in the running community. 

 With sprint training, we place a higher emphasis on building our running economy. Also in The Happy Runner, the Roche is point out an example where researchers tested       ( world record holder in the marathon ) VO2 max in 1991 when she was a teenager at 70ml / min / kg, and in annual tests thereafter marked no observable improvements while she got immensely faster. The authors surmise that “   is running economy improved about 15 percent, so she did too. ” Since a VO2max test measures the amount of oxygen the body uses while at max effort, the test can indicate an athlete is aerobic capacity, yet has limitations in assessing the full capabilities for any individual. With an understanding of aerobic capacity and the correlations running economy can play in the development of faster aerobic race results, it becomes clear that incorporating speed sessions to an endurance training plan of any distance will drive results. This improvement affects any athlete, at any training level, by simply raising your max speed ceiling. 

 One of the simplest reasons to add sprint training sessions to your weekly mileage is variety. Running creates compounding stress on the same muscle groups, but it can also be mentally challenging to run the same routes week - in and week - out. If an athlete is training within a demanding work / life schedule, they will prioritize convenience to ensure they meet their weekly volume quotas. This can mean running the same loop close to home or work repeatedly not only throughout a week, but sometimes within the same daily running session. Adding sprint sessions can give the athlete a new challenge, and is an easy way to add intensity to a training plan. Another bonus is that with sprinting, there is no need for any extra equipment, just a surface long enough to cover the required session distance. 
 How and When to Add Sprint Training Sessions 

 There are many ways that sprint sessions can be added to your weekly training plan. Most training plans include strides at the end of one of the shorter sessions, so some sprint work is already being added to most athletes ’ weekly mileage. However, to see the greatest adaptations to sprint work a more strategic and thoughtful approach will improve sprint performance further. In a 2015 study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research that looked at over 1400 subjects, across 48 previous studies, found that specific sprint training methods improved the speed of athletes for all distances. For distance runners, the goal should be to train both acceleration and maximal velocity. 

 One method for adding sprint sessions to a training plan is to schedule one to two sessions per week during an athlete is base building phase, preferably by replacing the stride sessions if those are part of the training plan. I suggest incorporating the sprint session at the beginning of the training session after an adequate warm - up. By inverting the day is plan, you give the athlete the opportunity to give the most quality to the component of training which is most beneficial. In a well designed training session, sequencing should see speed and power units ahead of any strength and endurance units. So if an athlete is planning on a general aerobic or slower paced run on a training day, prioritize the speed session at the beginning to gain the most value out of the day is session. In other words, do the higher priority and harder stuff first. 

 If an athlete is already doing strength sessions in the gym during a training cycle, short sprint sessions can be added to these workouts. As long as overall training volume is taken into consideration, adding a quality sprint component to the beginning of a gym session, where an athlete is working on other power components, can be an effective method. This tends to stack the sessions that induce the most tissue damage in the same day to allow for adequate recovery time. Be sure to monitor the athlete if using this training approach. Each athlete is different, and adding too much to an individual session can cause overload. It is better to do a little bit of that high quality work if more is going to sacrifice overall training quality. Listen to the athlete and adjust as necessary. Follow the session sequence from above with speed and power before strength and endurance. That means begin the session with sprint work before getting into any strength work for the day. 

 A third place to add a short sprint session to a training plan is during what is known as a quota day. A quota day is typically a shorter, easier run at the end of a week that an athlete uses to fulfill weekly mileage quotas. These typically fall the day after a long run, and two days before a quality interval session. The timing suggestion for adding these sprint sessions is to ensure a full day of recovery from any other hard session prior to and directly following the workout. This ensures full recovery before a workout that induces heavier tissue damage. Again, follow the sequencing as if you were adding these to base building runs where the sprint session is included at the beginning of a run. It is all about priority and making sure you do not come into a sprint session with per - fatigued muscles and risk injury. 
 Speed Training Options 

 There are two different sprinting skills that require training, and they have different session characteristics. Those skills are acceleration, or the ability to gain speed in a short amount of time, and maximal velocity, or the highest possible sprint speed you can achieve. 

 To train for acceleration, you can use a variety of methods that include short distance sprint accelerations, resisted runs, or hill sprints. The goal should be to keep each repetition at or under 30 m and to allow for around 1 minute of rest for each 10 m of sprinting or 1:20 to 1:40 work to rest ratio. Total volume for a session should not exceed 300 m and take into consideration athlete experience level, total training volume, and time constraints. 
 Acceleration workout session : 

 Perform the following sets and reps at a max effort level, and use a two point start position. A two point start position is starting with both feet on the ground in a stance similar to a football wide receiver prior to the snap. For athletes with injury history or returning from injury, use a “ drop - in ” to start ( a skip into the sprint start ) to reduce the force of starting from standing. 

     5 times @ 10 m w/ 1 minute rest 
     2 minutes rest then into 
     4 times @ 20 m w/ 2 minutes rest 
     4 times @ 30 m w/ 2 minutes rest 

 To train for maximal velocity, you can use methods that include assisted sprints, flying starts, and sprint - float - sprints. The goal should be to keep each repetition at or under 60 m and to allow for between 2 to 4 minutes of rest between reps or 1:20 to 1:40 work to rest ratios. Total volume for a session should not exceed 300 m. 
 Maximal Velocity workout session : 

     6 times @ 15 m flying sprint with 30 m run - in w/ 2 minutes rest 

 Sprint training can seem like an incredibly daunting world to venture into for endurance athletes, but it does not have to be complex to be effective. As studies have proven, this can be one of the most beneficial training sessions for endurance athletes at all levels. It requires very little time and even less equipment. Just start small and build these sessions into your training plan as the body adapts. Most importantly, have fun with it. Running really fast on a field or a track will make you feel like a pro athlete, and it beats running that same neighborhood loop for the billionth time. More importantly, it will make you a faster runner and running fast is essentially the goal whether that be over a distance of 100 meters or 100 miles. So, get out there and channel your inner Usain Bolt. Who knows, maybe you were a sprinter all along. 











 A runner is typical week of training involve workouts at a variety of paces, ranging from slow, easy runs for recovery and basic aerobic endurance to threshold efforts and race - pace intervals to build fitness for a specific race distance.   But perhaps the least - used pace in the average runner is training is the fastest one — sprint training. 

 While some runners include a couple of strides once a week to keep in touch with their speed, doing true sprint workouts on a regular basis is not very popular.   While this might make sense, as only the last hundred meters or so of a distance race involve actually sprinting, the usefulness of training all - out speed nevertheless merits some scientific investigation. 
 Can sprint training substitute hard work? 

 Sprint training gets something of a bad rap as a shortcut for quick results.   This is somewhat deserved, given the amount of people touting it as a total replacement for old - fashioned hard work. 

 Given what we already know from the collective wisdom of thousands of runners putting in traditional training over many years, sprint training will never be a true replacement for easy running, aerobic workouts, and race - specific work, but could prove to be a useful addition to our training regimen, depending on what the science says. 

 While there have been plenty of studies on the use of sprint training ( narrowly defined here as short, high - intensity intervals at speeds well over that of your usual race distance ) in untrained people, which usually show that these “ high - intensity interval training ” or HIIT sessions are quite effective at getting short - term results, we ’re only interested in the effects of sprint training in well - trained runners or endurance athletes. 

 Instead of focusing on whether sprint training is superior to any other kind, we should instead take note of what effect it has on fitness so we can predict when and how to integrate it into training. 
 Sprint training and fitness 

    Their study investigated the muscular adaptations that occurred in response to six sessions of sprint training ( 4 - 7 x 30 seconds all - out with four minutes recovery ) spread out over two weeks. 

 Using eight reasonably fit cyclists, they measured a variety of muscular parameters before and after the six interval training sessions, comparing them to changes in a control group which did not do any sprint training. 

     After the two - week training intervention, the cyclists showed a significant increase in muscular markers for storing and processing fuel during exercise. 

     However, they had no change in their VO2 max, the amount of oxygen they used during exercise. 

     The performance of the cyclists in a ride - to - exhaustion improved dramatically as well, moving from 26 minutes until exhaustion to 51 minutes. 

 The lack of improvement in VO2 max implies that most or all of the improvements in the riders ’ fitness came from improvements in muscular efficiency and energy production, instead of the cardiovascular improvements observed when an athlete does traditional endurance training. 
 Sprint training and performance 

 The specifics of how sprint training elicits improvements in the muscles was examined in more detail.   Before and after seven trained runners underwent a six - week training program of workouts with 5 - 15 second sprints, they  measured the levels of biological markers of fast, anaerobic athletic performance in the athletes ’ muscles. 

 Like with       study, the athletes showed a significant improvement in time and distance covered over a run to exhaustion.   They linked these improvements to increased levels of a specific type of protein in the muscles called the monocarboxylate transporter 1, or MCT1.   This protein functions as a “ shuttle ” to move lactate in and out of your muscles during exercise, transporting it from your legs to less - stressed areas where it can be reused as fuel. 

 This could explain why short programs of sprint training appear to have a positive impact on endurance performance, even without any improvements in aerobic fitness : by quickly removing metabolic byproducts from your muscles, you are able to sustain a higher level of energy production over a long period of time. 
 Biological effects 

 Increasing levels of one protein, however, is probably not the only important effect of sprint training.   In a 2002 review study,    ,    , and     at the University of Cape Town in South Africa extensively examined the biological effects of high - intensity sprint training. 

 A range of studies demonstrated increases in performance, accompanied by higher levels of biological markers for anaerobic fitness, fatigue resistance, and power production, but many of these studies used untrained individuals.   Among the studies of well - trained athletes, sprint training still elicited significant improvements in fitness, but most of the benefits were gained in the first six sessions of sprint training. 

 Further bouts of sprint - style interval workouts resulted in smaller marginal benefits than the initial six or so, typically spread out over two or three weeks.    they speculate that highly trained athletes respond more selectively to sprint training than sedentary people : because their fitness is already well - developed, their adaptations to sprint training are mostly in the form of better energy production in the muscles and more efficient processing of metabolic byproducts like lactate. 

 Sprint - style workouts, like 7×30 seconds at near - maximum effort with plenty of recovery are quite different from standard workouts for endurance in distance runners.   While these workouts might seem like an attractive shortcut to fitness based on studies of untrained individuals, a well - trained distance runner responds much more selectively. 
 How to incorporate sprint training into your schedule 

 Though sprint training can offer distance runners benefits in the form of better management of rising lactate levels and higher energy production in the muscles, it is not a replacement for the standard workouts that make up the bulk of your training. 

 To date, scientific research indicates that doing around six sessions of high - intensity sprint training spread out over a few weeks will net you the biggest benefits associated with this type of training. 

 As with everything else in training, if you ’d like to integrate sprint workouts into your routine : 

     You should do it gradually — start with only a couple 15 - 30 second repeats, taking ample time to recover between each.   Over the course of several weeks, you could work your way up to more repeats. 

     Doing workouts based solely on the testimony of a scientific paper can be a risky endeavor because physiology research is an inherently myopic field of study — benefits at four or six weeks are typically the focus, while long - term results and risks are given relatively less attention. Meaning, do not focus your training schedule on sprint training for a long period of time. A quick 3 - 5 week segment, especially after a marathon,   and a sprint session every few weeks can get you the benefits you need 

     Do not forget that sprint training will put a lot of stress on your body, given the extremely high speeds associated with it, and could lead to overuse injuries if you do not ease into it. 

 Hopefully, this article provided insight into why sprint training is important and how it will eventually help your training in the long - term, even if you ’re a marathoner.   Remember, developing top end speed takes time, especially if you have never done it before. Be patient ! 















 There is not just one style of yoga. This popular form of mind - body exercise has many different varieties, each with its own discipline, focus, and goals. 

 Power yoga, for example, is designed specifically to improve muscle strength and cardiovascular endurance. The poses are challenging, and you move from one pose to the next quickly. 

 It provides a good physical workout and, unlike some other styles of yoga that follow the same series of poses each time, power yoga classes are seldom alike. 

 This article will take a closer look at power yoga, its benefits, possible drawbacks, and how to get started. 
 What is power yoga?         

 As the name suggests, power yoga is focused on building strength and endurance. It is also an excellent form of yoga for burning calories. 

 Although power yoga is not an official type of yoga, the term is sometimes used interchangeably with Vinyasa yoga. It is probably more accurate to say that power yoga is a form of Vinyasa, which has its roots in Ashtanga yoga, an established practice that began in the early 20th century. 

 With power yoga, the emphasis is on the flow from one pose to the next, rather than approaching each pose separately. The poses are not disconnected from each other, unlike some other forms of yoga. 

 No matter what you call it, power yoga is a fast - paced and intense activity. You move from one posture to another rapidly, linking your breathing to the different motions of your body. 

 A power yoga class may seem more like an aerobics class than a relaxed, mindful yoga experience. Though it requires mindfulness and focus on your breathing, power yoga is more dynamic than meditative. 
 What are the key differences between power yoga and other types of yoga? 

 Power yoga differs from other types of yoga in a few important ways. Let is look at these differences more closely. 
 Speed 

 Unlike yoga, the most common form of yoga practiced in the United States, power yoga moves at a much faster pace. 

   yoga focuses on poses and breathing at a slower, more deliberate pace than power yoga. 

 The slower speed of yoga, and other forms of yoga that provide a more restorative experience, do not deliver the same cardiovascular exercise benefits as power yoga. 
 Sequence 

 Power or Vinyasa yoga uses many of the same postures as Ashtanga yoga, but not always in the same order. 

 Ashtanga yoga is a very precise practice, and each pose is done in the same sequence, no matter who is leading the class. 

 Power yoga classes, on the other hand, follow a sequence set by the instructor, or by the individual if you ’re on your own. There is more variability and less structure with power yoga. 
 Flow 

 One of the main differences between and Vinyasa or power yoga is in the flow. 

 Power yoga emphasizes the flow from one pose to the next, exhaling as you change positions.   yoga is less focused on the flow of poses and more focused on achieving the right posture with each pose. 
 What are the benefits? 

 According to scientific evidence, power yoga provides a wide range of both mental and physical benefits. Here is a look at some of the key benefits of this fast - flowing yoga style. 
 Cardiovascular health 

 Because of the fast pace and resistance training involved, research Trusted Source shows that power yoga workouts can raise and sustain your heart rate. 

 Getting your heart rate up during exercise helps your body circulate blood and oxygen to your muscles and organs more efficiently. This, in turn, can help improve your fitness, stamina, and overall health. 

 Additionally, regular cardiovascular exercise, like power yoga, can benefit you by : 

     strengthening your heart and lungs 
     helping control high blood pressure 
     improving cholesterol levels 
     controlling blood sugar levels 
     building stronger bones and muscles 
     helping with weight loss 
     improving sleep 
     boosting energy levels 
     improving brain function 
     lowering your risk for chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, and diabetes 

 Strength 

 Although a power yoga class is fast - paced, that does not mean you will not hold any poses for a length of time. You may hold some poses for a minute or longer. 

 When you hold your body in a particular position for more than a few seconds, it fires up your muscles and makes them work hard to keep you in a pose. This can boost your muscle strength and endurance in many parts of your body. 
 Motor control 

 In a 2016 study, Trusted Source published in the journal, Complementary Therapies in Medicine, people with Parkinson is disease who participated in twice - weekly power yoga sessions had significant improvements in their tremors and muscle rigidity. 

 Researchers also found that power yoga increased muscle strength and power in the study participants. 
 Weight loss 

 Because it gives you a cardio workout, power yoga burns calories. Improved muscle tone and strength from power yoga also means you will burn more calories even when you ’re not exercising. 

 According to a 2013 study, yoga may help you feel more connected to your body. This may make you more aware of when to stop eating, which can aid in weight loss. 

 Additionally, the study found that yoga can help reduce back and joint pain, which may encourage people with this type of pain to be more active. 
 Stress reduction 

 Yoga is well known for its ability to reduce stress and anxiety, and promote feelings of relaxation and calm. 

 Even though power yoga is less meditative and more fast - paced than some types of yoga, a 2017 study found that power yoga has the ability to decrease levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, in your body. 

 The study suggests that even one session of power yoga may result in a noticeable reduction in stress. 
 Overall health 

 Power yoga is associated with other key markers of good health, such as : 

     better sleep 
     a stronger immune system 
     improved posture and balance 

 Additionally, according to a study, Trusted Source in the Journal of Women is Health, Vinyasa or power yoga may be a helpful tool with helping smokers quit tobacco. 

 The participants in this study who took part in twice - weekly yoga sessions also reported reduced anxiety and improvements in their perceived health and well - being. 
 Are there any drawbacks? 

 Power yoga classes move at a fast pace and require a certain level of strength and fitness. Without a basic understanding of standard Vinyasa poses and movements, you may find it challenging to keep up. 

 As with any workout routine, using proper form is essential to avoid straining your muscles and joints. If you ’re not familiar with the yoga poses, you may risk injury by trying a pose with the incorrect form. 

 Power yoga classes are often 60 to 90 minutes long. The time commitment could be a drawback, especially if you ’re not used to exercising or working out for that length of time. 
 Is it right for you? 

 If you ’re comfortable in an intense fitness class environment ( think CrossFit ), power yoga may be a good fit for you. 

 It may also be a good choice if you have a decent level of fitness and are accustomed to working out for 60 minutes or longer. Having some familiarity with other forms of yoga and yoga poses is helpful, too. 
 How to get started 

 Power yoga classes are typically taught at fitness centers or yoga studios. When starting out, look for beginner or introductory classes, and ask your friends or co - workers for recommendations. 

 You may not see classes listed as “ power yoga ” courses, but instead they may be called Vinyasa yoga classes. 

 Before signing up, talk with the instructor or people working at the fitness center or studio to learn more about the power yoga class and what it includes. Also find out what level of expertise or fitness is needed for the class. 

 If you ’re new to yoga, you may want to consider an introductory class in yoga. This can help familiarize you with a variety of yoga poses and how to do them correctly. 

 If you ’d prefer to practice power yoga on your own at home, there are many online videos you can stream and follow along. You may also want to try out a yoga app that you can download to your phone or tablet. 

 If you have a chronic condition such as heart disease or arthritis, have an injury, or you are pregnant, check with your doctor about whether power yoga is safe for you. 
 The bottom line 

 Power yoga, which is also known as Vinyasa yoga, is a fast - paced style of yoga that is focused on building strength and endurance. It is also an excellent form of yoga for burning calories. 

 Although it requires mindfulness and focus on your breathing, power yoga is more dynamic than meditative forms of yoga, and provides a good cardio and strength - training workout. 

 You do not need weights or other equipment, but it helps to have a certain level of strength and fitness for this style of yoga. 













 Vinyasa or flow yoga is among the most popular forms of yoga today, yet it may seem intimidating to newcomers to the fitness scene. The Vinyasa style is characterized by a continuous flow of poses, similar to a dance or tai chi. The postures and transitions are linked together with the breath, so often each pose immediately flows to the next. This fast - paced style of yoga differs from more traditional styles of yoga, which focus on holding each pose in a steady, static position. Vinyasa is a dynamic and high - energy practice that builds heat in the body, develops strength, and stimulates the cardiovascular system. 

 When first learning this type of yoga practice, many people take a beginner class or workshop either online or at your local studio. Vinyasa flow is also known as power yoga, as it can be a very challenging physical practice. Thus it is helpful to be exposed to the sequence of poses and breathing exercises it uses before attending a live class. 

 Whatever your choice, make sure you study with experienced teachers certified by the Yoga Alliance. Once comfortable with its pace, format and variety of postures, you can enjoy the many benefits it brings. 
 Reasons to practice Vinyasa Yoga 

 While this approach to yoga requires a high amount of physical activity, there are many great benefits that arise with a regular practice. Some of these benefits are common in other schools of yoga, while others are unique to vinyasa. 

     Enhances Core Stability 
     The key to developing core strength is to not only engage the muscles in your lower torso but also to stabilize the spine to prevent low back strain. Vinyasa yoga incorporates a variety of poses that engage and strengthen your core muscles. Moving through a complicated sequence of side bends, back bends, and twists uses your own body weight to build core strength and will improve stability, power and balance. 
     Improves Mobility and Range of Motion 
     Maintaining a good range of motion and proper mobility is a key factor in reducing injury, improving posture, and completing daily tasks without pain. Luckily, the sun salutations and yoga asanas incorporated into Vinyasa have the effect of enhancing your mobility. The combination of fast - paced movements and muscle strengthening exercises provides an opportunity to increase range of movement while building strength for healthy mobility. 
     Keeps your Heart Healthy 
     Vinyasa yoga, whether you ’re taking a dynamic class or simply practicing morning sun salutations, is considered to be light - intensity aerobic physical activity. Regular cardiovascular exercise is essential to improving and maintaining good heart health. Upper back - bending postures can also increase circulation in the heart and surrounding muscles and tissues. 
     Vinyasa Flow Benefits Calms the Mind and Reduces Stress 
     The flowing movements of this practice are not only great exercise, but it is also considered a moving meditation. Moving through a sequence of poses requires focus, concentration, and deep breathing. This in turn calms your mind and relieves stress. If you suffer from anxiety, worry, burnout, or other stress - related problems, this style may be just the thing for you. 
     Boosts Mood 
     While most people think of yoga as an activity that helps keep the body fit and flexible, it can also help regulate the emotions. Vinyasa is a great way to unwind, focus on the present, and gain clarity on all the different aspects in your life.

You can do different poses to experience different mood changes, such as energization or relaxation. Yoga also teaches you to focus on the positive and see the world in a more positive way, rather than a negative way. 
     Grants Flexibility 
     Yoga is a great way to build flexibility and ease stiffness in your joints. Particularly if you live a sedentary lifestyle, practicing Vinyasa flow can allow you to stretch and strengthen each muscle throughout your yoga practice. The warming nature of this style encourages the muscles to soften and be more receptive to deep stretching.

The fluid movements and mindful breathing techniques grants better sleep by easing tension in your body and reducing worry in your mind. One caveat — as flow yoga can get your heart pumping, it is not advised to practice right before bedtime. 
     Stabilizes and Regulates the Emotions 
     Performing yoga poses helps you have greater emotional stability by calming the nervous system and improving your sense of well - being and self - acceptance. Learning detachment and expanding your consciousness makes us balanced and at peace with ourselves. These skills allow you need to return to this balance when you experience negativity or any strong emotional upsets. 
     Increases Lung Capacity 
     One of the most important benefits that yoga can give to you is a stronger respiratory system. Vinyasa translates into “ breath - synchronized movement, ” so breathing is a critical component of the yoga practice. Deep breathing works to expand the lungs to their fullest with air and to strengthen the diaphragm. By routinely expanding your lungs, you can boost your lung health and improve your lung capacity, which is helpful in lung problems such as asthma or bronchitis. 
     Bolsters Energy Levels 
     There is scientific evidence that yoga can directly improve energy levels and vitality. It is believed that the practice of asanas and pranayama release of endorphins, increase blood flow to the brain, and reduce the amount of ruminative and negative thoughts. It has been shown that poor posture can be directly related to lower energy levels which yoga can help correct. 
     Burns Calories 
     Vinyasa yoga keeps you moving almost constantly, which helps you to burn more calories and boost your metabolism than a regular hatha yoga class. Studies have shown that people who practiced yoga regularly were able to lose weight and body fat, and improve fitness. An hour - long moderate level class can burn between 400 to 600 calories. 
     Improves Body Image 
     If you are looking for a way to boost your body image and improve your self - esteem, vinyasa flow yoga can be an excellent choice. The mindfulness, self - awareness, empowerment and community that comes with yoga can change your life.

 Conclusion 

 Vinyasa yoga is a practice that helps enhance overall health and well - being, which in turn, helps one lead a healthier yogic lifestyle. There are many types of yoga you can study and explore to suit different needs and goals. If you like the faster pace and intensity of vinyasa, you might also enjoy flow, power, ashtanga or hot yoga classes. Some vinyasa yoga classes are combined with long - held yin yoga postures to create a more accessible and therapeutic and balanced yoga program. Even though yoga is a great form of exercise that can help you feel alive and vibrant, it is not without its risks. If you push yourself too hard or do not receive proper training, you can injure yourself and do more harm than good. Whichever yoga style you study, the most important factor to receive the benefits of yoga is to practice regularly. 










 As someone who works out A LOT, I definitely have my favorite exercises. You know I ’m all about HIIT classes, but to be honest I also love to mix it up. It keeps me out of a rut so I do not get used to a routine and slack during the workout. You also need to balance your routine to treat your body right. 

 Speaking of balance, yoga and strength training are a match made in heaven, though many do not take advantage of the overall balance they offer each other. 

 About 30 % of adult Americans do weight training and around 36 million practice yoga. However, these worlds do not collide as often as they ought to ! 

 Combining the stress - relief and flexibility that yoga provides with the muscle - building features of strength training will give you a balanced workout that affects your mind, body, and soul. 

     Looking for balance? We offer over 60 classes every week at our local gym. Grab a spot today. 

 Benefits Of Yoga 

 I love being able to slow down and lean into the quiet moments of a yoga session. Yoga has long been known to provide stress relief, inner peace, and improved emotional health. This total mind - body workout has been shown in numerous studies to reduce stress and anxiety ( Mayo Clinic ). 

 The controlled breathing that is a key part of yoga helps control your body and put your mind at rest. In addition, many yoga sessions have an additional focus on meditation and relaxation, which helps you practice mindfulness and be “ in the moment ” so to speak. 

 However, the benefits of yoga are not all in your head – yoga also has a wonderful impact on your physical fitness. From better balance and flexibility to a higher range of motion and strength, yoga can loosen you up and help build and tone muscles. 

 If you have tried yoga for the first time, the only thing you probably remember is that first session was painful. Many beginners ca not touch their toes or hold poses without wobbling around and resetting over and over – and that is very normal ! Over time, regular yoga sessions will relieve aches and pains, tight muscles will start to loosen up, and your balance will improve along with your range of motion. 

 Yoga also protects your spine, cartilage, and joints ; it improves your posture and bone health, increases blood flow, and boosts your immunity. 

 According to Yoga Journal, practicing yoga regularly has been shown to increase the drainage of lymph, a fluid rich in immune cells. This helps your lymphatic system fight infections ! 

 The benefits of yoga seem to go on forever, but some people will point out the shortcomings of sticking yoga classes exclusively. Remember, it is all about balancing your workout routine. Where yoga may be lacking is where strength training seems to shine. 
 Benefits Of Strength Training 

 Strength training does the obvious – it enhances your muscle mass. However, the benefits of strength training do not stop there. 

 Regular strength training stresses your bones, which will ultimately increase bone density, helping fight off conditions like osteoporosis and arthritis. 

 For those looking to manage their weight, strength training can be a real golden ticket – it increases your metabolism, which helps you burn more calories throughout the day. 

 According to the Mayo Clinic, strength training can also have the ability to enhance your overall quality of life ! By building muscle, everyday tasks because easier. For example, you have less risk of falling. This can help you stay independent with age. 

 About aging – it is expected that as you age, you will start losing up to 5 % of your lean muscle mass per year. A recent study showed that just 30 minutes of strength training twice per week can counteract that. 

 There is a big movement happening that says strong is the new sexy. I ’m not talking bodybuilder crazy muscles with the flexibility of a statue ( is that why they ’re so good at posing? ), but some definition and tone that shows off your strength. If you ’re after the “ sexy strong ” look, you ca not ignore the benefits of strength training. 

 But now we ’re practically at the complete opposite end of the workout spectrum from yoga. What gives? 
 Yoga and Strength Training Are Complementary 

 Yoga and strength training are like peanut butter and jelly – or lulu and messy buns. They compliment each other so well because where one lacks, the other shines, and vice versa. 

 Yoga has a total mind - body effect that builds and strengthens the longer you practice it. Strength training has the power to fill your life with vitality, especially as you age. 

 Both have their place, but when combined, yoga and strength training offer a fully balanced schedule that essentially doubles up the benefits you receive from your workouts. 
 Perks of Practicing Both Yoga and Strength Training 

 When you accompany yoga with strength training, you unlock this beautiful partnership that has an overwhelming impact on your mental and physical health. 

 Here are some of the perks you will notice when you practice both. 
 Flexibility and Strength Building 

 If you lift weights exclusively, you get the benefit of strength building. However, that is often at the expense of flexibility. 

 When you combine yoga and strength training during your weekly routine, you get the benefits of both ! 
 Better Breathing During Your Strength Training Workouts 

 We have all been in that place where your body is under tension and you are holding your breath, waiting for the release so we can huff and puff as we relax. This is terrible form, but it can become a habit when you do not practice good breathing techniques. 

 That is where yoga comes in. A huge component of yoga is controlled breathing, and by staying mindful about your breathing and employing the techniques you have learned, you will double up on the muscle - building benefits. 
 Muscle Mass and Endurance 

 Strength training gives you the obvious benefit of increased muscle mass. However, you can miss out on muscle endurance, and muscle flexibility. Fortunately, this is where yoga shines. 

 Yoga offers muscle tone and endurance through its slow - moving poses that force your body to hold positions for extended periods of time. This not only will help you lift weights during your strength training sessions, but it extends to everyday life. Yep, even something as simple as getting off the couch will become easier. 
 Less Chance of Injury 

 Yoga is known to improve your range of motion while also encouraging better posture. While this will help you avoid back pain if you ’re sitting at a desk all day, it also transfers to your strength training efforts. 

 By adding yoga into your weekly routine, you will be far less likely to suffer from a weight lifting - related injury. Better range of motion around your joints – which yoga provides – will help you lift safely. 
 Boosted Speed and Power 

 It is easy to start lagging in a long yoga session, but strength training can really help. Doing explosive movements like squats and plyometrics not only strengthen your core, but they develop muscle fibers. 

 These benefits will help reinforce your yoga poses while boosting your speed and power as you move from stance to stance. Essentially, you will feel in greater control of your body. 
 Stress Management 

 As previously mentioned, yoga is a major stress reliever, which promotes better emotional health. 

 Where strength training can shine in a different way is controlling anger and aggression. That is right – lifting and doing explosive movements helps develop controlled aggression. 

 When combined with yoga, you will end your week feeling in control and relaxed. 
 Yoga and Strength Training : A Complete Workout For Mind, Body, and Soul 

 Ultimately, when yoga and strength training are combined, it creates a routine that hits every aspect of your mind, body, and soul. 

 Not only do you benefit from muscle building, but you also get muscle endurance. Not only do you benefit from balance and flexibility, but you also increase your speed and power. 











 We have all seen the masterful acrobatics on Instagram with people lifting themselves into the most impressive of yoga poses and holding them for what seems an impossible amount of time. Anyone can see that takes a lot of strength and control. 

 It may seem like yogis and weight trainers are two separate tribes, but as we seek out more diverse and balanced approaches to strength training, could incorporating yoga into your training help you on your quest for strength? And if you ’re already on board with yoga, how can you make sure it is complementing your strength training? 

 Each week three trainers from Stylist Strong, Stylist is fitness brand that runs strength - training classes focused on incorporating weights into fitness, explain some of the most - asked questions from women who want to get into lifting. 

 This week they ’re explaining the role yoga can play in strength training and ways to make sure it is not working against you. 
 Is yoga good for strength training? 

 CAROLINE BRAGG, MASTER TRAINER AT STYLIST STRONG 

 “ Yes, but it depends on what kind of yoga you ’re doing and what kind of strength training you ’re doing. If we ’re talking about restorative yoga, that might not necessarily link in as much because that is much more about relaxation. But if we ’re talking about it benefiting what you ’re doing in your strength class, I ’d say focus a bit more on slow or dynamic work, where you ’re working on mobility rather than stretching. Range of motion, or ROM, is important to get the full range in our muscle. So sometimes you see people squat and they ca not squat that low, and it is better to get that full range of motion in the squat or that full hip hinge, so something like yoga or pilates would be beneficial. ” 

  

 “ If you ’re very flexible, then your muscles tend to be looser, and when you ’re strength training you kind of want your muscles to be tighter. So it is important to pick which yoga class you go to if you do want to include it in your exercise routine. If you go to something like hatha or vinyasa where it is strengthening you, it is also mobilising and some people do need more mobility in their joints. That will make them stronger because it means they can get into positions more easily or into positions that they could not get into before.   At Stylist Strong we have the Strong yoga classes, which are great, but if a class involves lots of stretching, then it is counterproductive to strength training. Something that people may want to be cautious of if they ’re going from a pure yoga background into strength training is their range of movement. People who do yoga are incredibly flexible and have a lot of range. They tend to come into positions a little bit too far and they lose the tension in the muscles and then it becomes a bit more ' tendony ' and that is when you tend to get injuries. ” 

  

 “ It is definitely very good for strength training as a complementary thing, because yoga also builds strength, just like weightlifting does, but you ’re using your own body weight to develop strength. It also develops spatial awareness in terms of your body, your sense of balance. You ’re also lengthening those muscles and increasing your flexibility, which is a really good thing to do when you ’re also doing weight / resistance training, because a lot of the exercises may be shortening your muscles or maybe you ’re not doing adequate stretching after your sessions. Yoga is a great way to ensure you ’re still flexible and mobile so in terms of your body mobility and range of motion, I definitely think yoga is a great thing to do alongside weight training. 

 What is a good balance for combining the two? 

 CAROLINE BRAGG, MASTER TRAINER AT STYLIST STRONG 

 “ Strengthening with weights will help your yoga and yoga can help your strength training. So, they go hand in hand : your exercise routine should have balance in it. If all you ’re doing is lots of strength training and not mobilising, your strength training is going to be limited. And if you ’re just doing yoga and not adding in some strength training to get the stability you need in your joints, you ’re probably going to get injured. You can get very strong [ with yoga ] but strength training aids that a little bit quicker. So, if your goal is to do a handstand – if you are working on a press up and then working on some lat pull - downs and some overhead presses – you ’re going to have the stability in the shoulder and the strength through the shoulder to come into that handstand a lot quicker than if you would just kind of practicing flinging yourself and hoping that you can carry your body in a handstand. 

  

 “ I would suggest doing about three strength sessions a week and focusing them around big compound lifts ; things like your deadlift, your squat, overhead press, bench press, bent - over row, and then maybe doing one yoga class a week would also be good. That is four sessions a week, which is quite a lot. But the yoga class would almost be like an active recovery class, so it is not too intense, to help your nervous system rest a little bit, but it keeps the body moving. Going for something like a sports massage is great, just nothing that is too vigorous and is going to create trauma. What you want is someone who is just going to do long, gentle strokes to increase the blood flow. And if you ’re doing a flow - based yoga, you ’re getting the same effect. So if you ’re moving pretty constantly in a class, vinyasa would be a good one for that, then you ’re increasing that blood flow around the body, which is going to help ease up the muscles if you have got any soreness. “ 

  

 “ Personally, I do not do yoga once a week simply because I do not have the time. You can do yoga once a month, once a fortnight, or once a week. I would go by how I feel because sometimes you want to take it slow. Do you want to move your body without having to lift weights because you want to have a low - impact recovery day? So, that is where you might take it easy – like a hatha yoga session. That is how I do it. I certainly would not do yoga more than once a week 

 Does Yoga mentally benefit strength training? 

  

  “ I really recommend yoga to people more so for the mental benefits than the physical. That is what I say to people all the time ; I think it is great for them to do it, but to go there and not push their bodies, just really tap into the mind and focus on being as present as possible. You can transfer that over into your strength training, because the strength training is probably going to be a little bit more taxing on the body. But if you can stay in that mindset of being really present and focusing on the task at hand, then that is a great way to be during any kind of training session.   Yoga is really good at making you feel aware of any aches or pains or little niggles, and the teachers will tend to make you aware of them before you even start the class. So from the get - go, you ’re just becoming very in touch with your body, which is great, especially for training. Some days you may not have warmed up properly and the movement feels a bit sticky, so you do not want to add too much load on if it is not feeling great because then you can get injured. ” 

  

 “ These days a lot of people are focused on aesthetics ; they want to be flexible, they want to look a certain way, but what we have got to remember is the whole point of yoga – originally, and I still agree with that – is mental. So, while you ’re increasing your mental focus, you also center yourself as well. It is great for reducing stress levels ; you connect with your mind and you kind of get into your body – you focus on your breathing, your movement. All of this is great in terms of centering yourself and in terms of your thoughts as well. When you practice yoga, you get that increased focus, increased mind - body connection, and also spatial awareness in terms of your body and coordination, which will also help you when it comes to free weights. 

 “ I go to yoga that is quite physical rather than mindful. I can only focus on what I ’m doing – I guess that is the same in yoga. You ’re focusing on what you ’re doing, rather than anything outside that could be coming in. ” 










 What Is Power Yoga? 

 Power yoga is a fast - paced Vinyasa - style yoga that was modeled on Ashtanga and is heavy on cardio, is physically demanding, and emphasizes dynamic movement over meditative movement. Power yoga classes typically include fewer poses that are held for longer. As opposed to Vinyasa classes, which include more poses held for shorter periods. 
 Bow Pose 

 Millions of people around the world practice yoga for its physical, mental, and emotional benefits. In the West, power yoga is one of the most popular types of yoga. Power yoga is geared towards athletes and most classes follow a flow of fast - paced movements that are more physically demanding than other yoga styles. 

 Power yoga might look different depending on where you practice, but there are a few key characteristics that most classes have in common : 

     Poses are held for a longer period of time ( up to a minute ) to help build strength 
     The classes are built to increase heart rate 
     Poses include a blend of Vinyasa and Ashtanga 

 Origins of Power Yoga 

 Power yoga is an offshoot of Ashtanga yoga and does not stick to a set sequence of asanas as Ashtanga does. It came to popularity in the United States in the mid-1990s when     and       separately took the Ashtanga yoga method and transformed it into a less rigid style of yoga. Yoga Journal credits Birch with creating " the original power yoga " in 1995, though     seems to be the one who actually coined the phrase. 

   says that the original name was " empower yoga, " but that he shortened it to " power yoga " because it was just easier to say. He jokes that he even considered changing the name to " grandma yoga " because he believed that anyone could do it. 

 When you consider that power yoga has oft been viewed as the realm of athletes or other already physically fit people, that might come as a surprise. However,   is " empower yoga " was intended to encourage practitioners to honor the needs of their own bodies during power yoga classes. This might mean you challenge yourself to do something you did not think possible and it could also mean that you skip poses that just are not possible for you. 

 What to Expect From a Power Yoga Class 
 Supported Triangle Pose 

 If you have never experienced a power yoga class, you 're in for a treat. As we mentioned earlier, power yoga is a blend of Ashtanga and Vinyasa yoga. These classes offer immediate benefits and help you live a healthier, happier life. Here is what to expect from the typical power yoga class. 

 You Will Sweat 

 Hydrate before, during, and after your power yoga class. Also, you will want to have a towel handy to keep things dry and safe. 

 You Will Be Challenged Physically 

 Power yoga is hard.   Holding poses for a minute or more is challenging on your body and the fast pace of these classes can make it more difficult to keep up. That does not mean that beginners ca not participate in and get a lot out of power yoga classes. Just do what you can, push your comfort zone a bit, and have fun. 

 You Will Be Challenged Mentally 

 In addition to the physical challenges of power yoga, there are mental challenges to such an intense practice, too. Even if you 're already familiar with yoga, be prepared for how power yoga comes together to create a unique challenge. 

 Benefits of Power Yoga 


 Like all types of yoga, power yoga has its fair share of both physical and mental benefits. It is associated with improved posture and balance, better sleep, and a stronger immune system, for starters. Here are a few other benefits of power yoga to keep in mind. 

 Improved Cardiovascular Fitness 

 Power yoga is fast - paced and endurance - based. This makes it a great option for improving cardiovascular health. Performing a cardio - heavy practice like power yoga regularly can help you strengthen your heart and lungs, improve cholesterol levels, control blood sugar and blood pressure, improve sleep, boost energy, and a whole lot more. 

 Increased Strength 

 Since power yoga includes long holds of certain poses, you will find increased strength a benefit of the practice. As you hold a static pose for a period of time, your body will engage the muscles needed to keep you stable in the pose, increasing strength and endurance. 

 Improved Circulation 

 Power yoga is going to get your heart rate pumping. In addition to the cardiovascular benefits, the increased heart rate also leads to better circulation. This means nutrients and oxygen will flow throughout your body better. 

 Better Stamina 

 Power yoga is a full - body strength and cardiovascular workout that will help improve your stamina ( the ability of your body to sustain prolonged physical and mental effort ). 

 Improved Motor Function 

 A 2016 study found that people with Parkinson is disease who practiced power yoga two times a week had significant improvements in tremors and muscle rigidity. Further, power yoga increased muscle strength and power in study participants. 

 Reduced Stress 

 Despite the fact that power yoga is less meditative than other types of yoga, it still contributes to overall reductions in stress and anxiety and promotes feelings of calm and relaxation. A 2017 study found that power yoga decreases the body is cortisol levels and suggests that just a single power yoga session might prompt a noticeable reduction in stress. 



 Power yoga is a fast - paced yoga style that will help you build strength and endurance. While it does require you to be mindful of your breathing, it is not a meditative class. Instead, power yoga emphasizes dynamic, powerful movements and long holds of poses to get the most physical benefit. 

 While power yoga can be practiced safely by just about anyone, the practice is not suitable for everyone. Pregnant people are cautioned against power yoga as certain poses can cause complications during pregnancy. If you 're pregnant, check out one of our prenatal yoga classes and save the power yoga for postpartum ! 

 In addition to pregnancy, there are a few other reasons you might want to avoid power yoga : 

     Diabetes 
     Heart problems 
     Carpal tunnel 
     Recent surgery 
     Recent physical injuries 

 If any of the above apply to you, that does not mean you absolutely ca not practice power yoga. However, you should definitely seek out the advice of your doctor for approval.

 Although mainstream media, in general, may lead us to believe that yoga is solely about physiological poses, it encompasses a wide range of reflective and self - discipline disciplines like meditation, chant, mantras, devotion, breathing exercises, tradition, and even great action. 

  It consists of various connotations ranging from astrological alignment to marriage, with the underlying notion of interconnectedness. 

 Vinyasa is a well - known kind of yoga that has evolved to satisfy changing needs. Hugely popular, this flow can be challenging to master, particularly if you lack the fundamental foundation. We will go over everything you need to learn about the advantages of Vinyasa yoga and the proper starting flow to keep you informed. 
 What Is Vinyasa Yoga? 

 Vinyasa yoga is a kind of yoga practise wherein a sequence of poses is linked together and practised constantly. The exercises are set to correspond with the proper breathing exercises. It is a continuous flow that is often regarded as an excellent cardiovascular exercise that will leave you sweating. 

 In Vinyasa yoga, every exercise is in sync with the breath. As you transcend from one position to the next, the breath takes prominence, acting as a grounding anchor. Vinyasa yoga classes, such as Ashtanga vinyasa yoga, Hot yoga, and Power yoga, use the term “ Vinyasa ” to describe the integration of breath and action. 

 It can be challenging to choose the proper type of yoga for you as there are plenty to choose from. Although both Ashtanga yoga and Vinyasa yoga are vigorous forms of yoga, they vary in different aspects that can make the process easier while causing the least harm. Although the difference between and Vinyasa yoga is that   yoga focuses on a specific posture at a time with rests somewhere between, Vinyasa classes focus on a pattern of poses. 

 Vinyasa yoga can allow you to improve your breathing stability and lose weight in a healthy and safe manner. 
 12 Science - backed Benefits of Vinyasa Yoga Practice 

 Systematic evidence into the Vinyasa yoga benefits is still in its early stages. Nonetheless, much of the data to date backs up what practitioners have claimed for generations — the Vinyasa flow class is beneficial to our well-being. 

 Let is take an in - depth look at 12 of the massive benefits of Vinyasa flow yoga. 
 Enhances Flexibility 

 One of the earliest and most evident benefits of yoga is increased flexibility. You will not be able to touch your toes, let alone complete a back bend, in your first Vinyasa class. If you persevere, you will observe a gradual relaxing of the muscles, and highly improbable poses will gradually become attainable. 

 Slow, controlled breathing and slow movements enhance blood flow, and warm muscles while maintaining a stance can help you gain strength. The Tree Pose is beneficial because it allows you to stand on one foot while keeping the other foot at a straight angle to your calf and above the knee. 
 Strengthens Muscles 

 Muscles are helpful for more than just looking great. It also shields us against illnesses like arthritis and lumbar pain and prevents falls in the elderly. And when you do yoga, you integrate strength with flexibility. 
 Helps With Back Pain Relief 

 Practicing yoga can help individuals with lower back discomfort relieve pain and improve mobility and basic stretching. Vinyasa yoga helps as first - line therapy for moderate to severe pain by the American College of Physicians. 

 The Cat - Cow Pose is considered a backache reliever in Vinyasa yoga. To do this, place your palms beneath your shoulders and your knees beneath your hips while on all fours. To begin, breathe deeply and let your stomach descend to the floor. Then exhale while drawing your navel closer to your spine and curving your back like just a cat stretching. 
 Strengthens Heart Health 

 Vinyasa yoga is not commonly thought of as a cardio workout, and it does not get your heart racing as hard as, like, jogging. However, it does work your heart and lungs and contribute to cardiovascular health. When you react rapidly through movements, the heart rate rises, and you produce strong cardiovascular endurance over time ; Vinyasa flow yoga helps. 
 Minimises Cartilage and Joint Deterioration 

 The joints are taken throughout their complete range of motion every time you practise the Vinyasa sequence. By “ clenching and soaking ” parts of cartilage that are not commonly used it can effectively deter degenerative arthritis or reduce disability. 
 Increases Blood Flow 

 Vinyasa yoga counts as an excellent method to have your blood pumping. Yoga is relaxation techniques, in particular, can improve overall circulation, particularly in the feet and hands. Yoga also supplies oxygen and nutrients in your cells, allowing them to work more effectively. Twisting poses should squeeze venous blood out of internal organs, allowing oxygenated blood to be pumped once a twist is relaxed. 
 Lighter Moods and Boosted Energy 

 After engaging in a yoga regimen, you may experience increased mental and physical energy, a surge in alertness and excitement, and lesser negative emotions. 
 Improves Bone Health 

 Weight - bearing activity is well known for strengthening bones and preventing osteoporosis. Numerous yoga positions may require you to elevate your body weight. Certain poses also reinforce the arm bones that are highly susceptible to osteoporotic fractures. 
 Assists in the Management of Stress Levels 

 As per the National Institutes of Health, existing research data demonstrates that yoga helps cope with stress, mental well-being, concentration, proper nutrition, weight loss, and good sleep. The Corpse Pose should be practised for 5 to 15 minutes. Lie on the floor with your hands facing up and your limbs slightly extended outward away from the body. 
 Cleanses the Body 

 Vinyasa yoga, combined with enough water and a good diet, can help with digestion and circulation. It aids in the detoxification and purification of our bodies and promotes a sense of wellness. 
 Promotes Better Sleep 

 A consistent evening yoga program, thus according to research, can allow you to get in the appropriate attitude and help your body to fall and sleep through the night. 
 Helps with Weight Loss 

 Individuals are using vinyasa yoga to lose weight. It is a slower - paced exercise that can help you lose weight more effectively than many other intense routines. However, for people interested in how many calories burned in Vinyasa yoga and how it affects weight loss, the continual motions of Vinyasa constitute a terrific regular activity. 
 The Science of Vinyasa 

 As the scientific evidence is still in its early stages, certainly compared to how long people have all been practising Vinyasa yoga, the findings are encouraging and corroborate what yoga instructors have been preaching for countless generations ; yoga is excellent for our overall well being. 

 Yoga encompasses a wide range of activities, the majority of which do not include physical activity but rather meditation approaches. 

 Vinyasa yoga, one of the best yoga classes Singapore, is a practice that may be done on a daily basis because it is not confined to physical activity. Choose the system that suits you best, and understand that engaging in a yoga practice is a commitment to yourself ! 












 As we all know, bodybuilding is a rigorous activity that involves building muscle mass through weightlifting, resistance training, and proper nutrition and supplementation. While bodybuilders focus on increasing their strength, muscle growth, and size, they may often overlook the importance of flexibility and mobility. This is where yoga comes in, a complementary activity that can benefit bodybuilders in numerous ways, even if it does not fit into the traditional bodybuilder image. 

 Yoga is an ancient practice that originated in India and has grown in popularity around the world over many years. Yoga involves a series of poses, breathing, and meditation techniques that promote physical, mental, and spiritual health. It is easy to see why bodybuilding is not often associated with something like yoga, as it focuses so much on building muscle mass and strength, and yoga emphasizes flexibility, balance, and mindfulness. 

 One of the primary benefits of yoga for bodybuilders is improved flexibility. Bodybuilders often have tight muscles due to the repetitive motions of weightlifting and resistance training. This can lead to muscle imbalances, reduced range of motion, and increased risk of injury. Yoga poses, such as downward dog, pigeon pose, and seated forward bend, can help to stretch and lengthen the muscles, improving flexibility and reducing the risk of injury. Yoga can directly improve how your muscles perform whilst bodybuilding. 

 Another benefit of yoga for bodybuilders is improved mobility. Many yoga poses require a full range of motion in the joints, which can help to improve joint health and mobility. Practicing yoga poses can be particularly beneficial for bodybuilders who often focus on specific muscle groups, neglecting smaller stabilizing muscles and joints. Improved mobility from practicing yoga can help to prevent injuries and improve how certain exercises are performed in the gym, giving superior results. 

 In addition to its physical benefits, yoga can also benefit bodybuilders mentally. Yoga is a form of meditation that encourages mindfulness and relaxation. Bodybuilders often experience high levels of stress due to the physical demands of their training regimen, diet restrictions, and their strict lifestyles. Practicing yoga can help to reduce stress levels, improve sleep quality ( which is essential for bodybuilders ) and promote overall mental well - being. 

 Yoga is actually a fantastic form of active recovery for bodybuilders. Active recovery involves engaging in low - intensity activities such as stretching, foam rolling, or yoga to promote muscle recovery and reduce soreness. Yoga can help to increase blood flow to the muscles, improve lymphatic drainage, and promote relaxation, all of which can aid in muscle recovery after a tough workout. 

 Finally, a nice addition for those interested in how their physique appears, yoga can help to improve posture and alignment. Bodybuilding often involves repetitive motions that can lead to poor posture and alignment, such as hunching over, etc. A poor posture can result in muscle imbalances and increased risk of injury. Yoga poses such as plank, mountain pose, and warrior pose can help to improve posture and alignment, again reducing risk of injury and improving overall body mechanics. 

 Ultimately yoga can be a great complementary activity for bodybuilders. Yoga offers numerous physical and mental benefits such as improved flexibility, posture, mobility, stress reduction, and active recovery. Yoga could prove to be very helpful in reducing the risk of injury and improving overall performance throughout training. Incorporating yoga into a bodybuilding routine could be what you need for overall health and well - being, but also to give you the best results for your time, both in and out of the gym. 














 When it comes to fitness, much of the focus is put on the workout itself. Want to lose weight? A more intense workout can increase your fat burn. Want to build muscle? Lift heavier weights on strength training days. But adequate recovery is also important, especially active recovery — and yoga is perfect for this purpose. 
 The Importance of Recovery 

 Remember that pushing a muscle to work harder causes tiny tears in the muscle fiber. It creates actual muscle damage. After a challenging workout, your body needs time to repair this damage. If time is not given, the muscle can weaken versus strengthen. The body is unable to recover effectively, and injury can occur. 

 A lack of adequate recovery can also lead to overtraining. You can only push the body for so long before it starts to break down. It is the same principle as allowing stress to continue to build without releasing it. You might not notice the effects at first, but they will eventually appear. The same is true with exercise. If you consistently overdo it, it will catch up with you at some point. 

 An injury can occur to the muscle or surrounding soft tissues ( ligaments, tendons ) if they endure repeated stress with limited recovery time. Overtraining can also lead to stress fractures. The bone can not sustain all of the physical activity, so it slowly starts to break. 

 A high - intensity workout can also result in delayed onset muscle soreness or DOMS. Giving the body time to recover can help reduce this soreness. It can also reduce muscle fatigue. 
 Passive Recovery vs Active Recovery 

 One way to engage in recovery is to take a rest day. This is called passive recovery and involves taking the day off entirely from any exercise. Passive recovery can be helpful on days when muscle soreness is at its peak. It is also a good option after completing a reasonably strenuous workout. 

 Another option is to stay active during recovery, though at a lower intensity. This is referred to as active recovery. Research indicates that active recovery offers many benefits. 

 For instance, a 2019 systematic review notes that active recovery positively affects performance ( 1 ). It also reports that participating in an active recovery session appears to improve psychological outcomes. A previous meta - analysis indicates that active recovery helps ease sore muscles ( 2 ). 

 Some use the term active recovery to describe doing less intense exercise between interval training sets. It is also used to reference reduced intensity during a cool down. For purposes of this article, the phrase “ active recovery ” describes being lightly active on rest days or active rest. 
 How Does Active Recovery Work? 

 An active recovery workout helps increase blood flow. Blood carries oxygen and many other nutrients that are helpful with recovery to the muscle cells. Light exercise can get the blood moving faster than when completely at rest. This gets more of these nutrients to the damaged areas. 

 Low - intensity movement can also help the body get rid of excess lactic acid. The more intense your physical exertion, the more lactic acid your body produces. The National Library of Medicine shares that too much lactic acid can lead to lactic acidosis ( 3 ). This causes nausea, weakness, and vomiting. Reducing lactic acid buildup helps you avoid these effects. 
 3 Persuasive Reasons to Use Yoga for Active Recovery 

 For an exercise to assist with active recovery, it must be low in intensity. Walking, light swimming, tai chi, and a leisurely bike ride qualify as active recovery exercises. Yoga is another option to consider on an active recovery day. Here are three persuasive reasons why. 

 Some yoga styles are more intense. Ashtanga and Vinyasa yoga are two.   styles are slower and aimed more toward recovery. That makes them perfect for an active rest day. Restorative yoga is good for an active recovery workout.   yoga and yin yoga are as well. Each of these practices goes from pose to pose in a slow, controlled fashion. 

 The light movements of low - intensity yoga help get the blood flowing. This makes it easier for the body to get nutrients to muscle cells. These nutrients can be used to better repair muscle damage. This also impacts the amount of soreness you might feel. The quicker the recovery, the shorter the duration of your soreness. 

 Part of effective recovery is knowing what your body needs and when. Yoga assists with this by increasing body awareness. You become more in tune with your body. This makes it easier to identify when it might need rest. It also helps avoid overtraining and, subsequently, injury. 
 Additional Yoga Benefits 

 Yoga offers many benefits that extend beyond those associated with active recovery. Johns Hopkins shares quite a few of them, some of which include ( 4 ): 

     Improving strength, balance, and flexibility 

     Providing back pain relief 

     Easing arthritis symptoms 

     Increasing heart health 

     Promoting better sleep 

     Boosting mood 

     Reducing stress 

 Arguably, each of these yoga benefits also assists with recovery. This is just one more reason to include yoga on your recovery day. 
 How Often Should You Engage in Active Recovery? 

 The answer to this question depends on your workout schedule overall. The more intense your exercise sessions, the more time you may need to recover from them. 

 Generally speaking, most people benefit from taking one or two active recovery days per week. This enables you to meet your fitness goals without over - stressing the body. 

 It is also important to regularly include passive recovery days in your routine. Give your body a day off from any type of exercise so it can relax fully. 

 Your yoga recovery sessions do not have to be lengthy either. Keep in mind that the goal is not to get a good workout. It is simply to stay lightly active while giving your muscles time to heal. Just 10 - 20 minutes of yoga on active recovery days is sufficient for this purpose. 













 The benefits of Yoga and bodybuilding go hand in hand. Yoga can help you stay healthy while bodybuilding can improve your overall body composition. Bodybuilding training involves intense workouts and rest, so it is important to rest your muscles between each workout. 

 But when you ’re not exercising, your muscles ca not repair themselves properly. Inactivity can slow down the recovery process. 

 Doing 20 to 30 minutes of Yoga on your rest day can help you warm up your muscles and get rid of metabolic waste products faster. Which means you will be stronger and less sore after your workout. 


 In addition to improving your overall fitness, yoga can help you avoid injury. Yoga will also increase your flexibility, which is important for bodybuilders. As muscles grow, they can interfere with the body is range of motion. 

 By doing yoga exercises, you will increase your flexibility, which will make it easier to develop your muscles. 

 And this will help you avoid the potential side effects of gaining muscle mass. Yoga and bodybuilding go hand in hand, so you may want to try them both out ! 
 Can You Be A Bodybuilder And Do Yoga? 

 Can yoga and bodybuilding be done together? Can you do both at the same time? Is it feasible and safe? These are questions I ’m going to answer for you. 

 Yoga takes only a few minutes. Learn how pose variety can help you break up a dull routine. 

 There are many ways to work yoga into your day so that it does not interfere with your other plans. You can do it in the morning, around your other workouts, or at night before bed. It is all about finding what works for you and your schedule. 

 Yoga and bodybuilding are mutually beneficial ways to improve your body is health, strength, and endurance 

 Bodybuilding can help you strengthen your muscles, which will in turn help you build your stamina for your yoga workouts. 

 Yoga will help you build strength and improve your mobility and recovery time.

 5 Best Yoga Poses For Bodybuilders 

 A lot of people wonder if yoga can help them build muscle. I love when people are surprised to hear that I do not lift weights, because it is one of the best parts of my day. 

 The key to gaining muscle without weights is to do the right exercises, like yoga poses, that help you push your endurance limits and break down your muscle fibers. That way, your body can build the muscle back up again. 
 Exercise 1 : Chair Pose 

 The Chair Pose, also called Utkatasana in Sanskrit, is an effective way to strengthen the legs and the entire body. The Sanskrit name “ utkata ” means “ powerful, ” and “ asana ” means “ pose. ” 

 It is an essential part of the sun salutation sequence and can be practiced on its own. A chair can be a great foundational yoga pose, especially for beginners who are interested in sculpting their bodies and strengthening their legs. 

 You will want your shoulder blades to slide away from your midline as you bend your arms. Make sure your arms are parallel to your torso, not up towards your ears. Your shoulder blades should slide down toward your back. 

 This pose mimics a lightning bolt hitting the floor. It can also be challenging for your shoulders. Beginners may need a wall to support their shoulders, but it is possible to modify the exercise. 

 The Chair Pose is challenging, but it is not impossible. The key is to find the balance between ease and effort. If you can engage the proper muscles and balance the weight evenly on each leg, you will be able to find stability in the posture. 

 So do not be intimidated. You will find that practicing in a chair pose will help you stay in position and maintain balance during pregnancy. You will feel the benefits of the chair pose sooner than you think. 
 Exercise 2 : Warrior 3 

 If you ’re looking for a challenging yet rewarding yoga pose, try Warrior 3 ! This challenging pose helps strengthen your legs, arms, shoulders, and back muscles. It improves your balance and posture. It is also a great way to increase your focus and concentration. 

 It is an excellent pose for yoga teachers to teach because of its many benefits. Read on to discover more about this powerful posture ! And do not forget to share the benefits of this challenging pose with your students ! 

 Warrior III is unique design allows your toes to breathe, which helps you to get more from your workout. Instead of wearing sneakers and other footwear, this pose frees your feet from a constraint. 

 If your ankles are trembling, try spreading your toes wider and putting your weight into the triangle formed by your big toe, pinky toe, and heel. With practice, you will soon be able to hold Warrior III without any difficulty. Warrior III is great for strengthening your knees, too. 

 The Warrior III posture stretches and aligns your spine, strengthening your core, and sharpening your focus. It also creates beautiful lines in your arms and spine. Your feet, knees, and hips will all be more grounded as a result of this posture. 

 If you ’re interested in a more challenging variation, try Yore Mi Warrior 3 or airplane pose. In either case, you will find the perfect pose for you ! 
 Exercise 3 : Plank 

 The plank pose can be an excellent exercise for beginners. It builds strength in the arms, shoulders, legs, and core. In addition to increasing strength, plank poses burn calories and boost metabolism. 

 In addition, planks improve overall stability. If you ’re looking for a challenging yoga pose that will help you improve your posture, try a plank. But remember to take a few minutes to learn the basics. 

 

 Practicing the plank pose will help you build stamina and increase your strength in other yoga poses. A certified yoga teacher can teach you the correct technique and techniques for performing the pose. 

  Practice it for about 15 to 30 seconds, and then add to the length. But make sure you practice it properly ! And do not forget to breathe ! 

 When practicing the yoga plank pose, remember to slowly build your core strength and stamina. There are several modifications of the classic yoga pose, which puts pressure on the wrists. 

 You can also try a forearm version if you ’re not strong enough to hold it for long. Whatever type you choose, the yoga plank poses will help build stamina and strengthen your abs. You will feel more confident, supple, and invigorated in the long run. 
 Exercise 4 : Dolphin Pose 

 This inverted posture is a good choice for those who feel unsteady in inverted positions and want to increase their self - confidence. The Dolphin Pose is also beneficial for strengthening your legs, arms, and core. 

 To practice it, start on all fours with your hands under your shoulders and knees under your hips. Then, lift your hips and shoulders. Lift your front and back thighs and open your hamstrings. 

 In the Dolphin Pose, your arms and shoulders stretch, preparing you for a more challenging inversion. It also teaches awareness and alignment, which are crucial for performing a proper inversion. 

 While performing this posture, your elbows should be parallel with your kneecaps and shoulders should be rolled back. As you lift your hips and head, keep your spine lengthened and your feet firmly grounded. 

 After practicing the Dolphin Pose, you should follow it with Downward - facing dog. Make sure not to overstretch your joints by completely straightening your legs. If you do this, your back may round, so keep your legs slightly bent. 

 Also, remember not to let your rib cage sink too far to the floor. To avoid overstretching, keep your shoulders firm against your back. Finally, hold your head between your upper arms and practice deep breathing. 

 If you have never tried a dolphin pose before, it is probably not the best way to practice it. It is tricky to start, and there are several variations of this posture that require a lot of practice. 

 To do it correctly, you should practice it four to six times a day. It is recommended that you do this pose for thirty to sixty seconds. As you become more confident, you can move on to the next level. 
 Exercise 5 : Haka Pose 

 This yoga pose is very effective in stretching your hamstrings, and it also helps open up your hip flexors and tone your core. If you want your body to look like Adonis, then this pose is for you. Hold it for 30 seconds, and try to build up to 2 minutes. 

 The benefits of this basic hip opener pose are extensive. In addition to improving flexibility and mobility in the lower body, it stimulates the internal organs. 

 It relieves all day muscle fatigue, improves digestion, and detoxifies the body. It also increases awareness and balance. The benefits of the yoga haka pose are immense. 

 So, be sure to do this pose as part of your daily exercise routine. You will be glad you did. 
 Therapeutic Benefits of Yoga 

 As the popularity of mind - body fitness programs, like yoga, continues to grow, it becomes increasingly important for healthcare professionals to be knowledgeable about yoga and its many proven therapeutic benefits. 

 This article provides helpful information on the therapeutic effects of yoga in various populations suffering from a multitude of different ailments and conditions. Therapeutic yoga is defined as the application of yoga postures and practices to the treatment of health conditions. 

 Yoga therapy involves instruction in yogic practices and teachings to prevent, reduce or alleviate structural, physiological, emotional and spiritual pain, suffering or limitations. 

 Yoga is often sought out as a complementary therapy for mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. 

 The relaxing and grounding nature of yoga can be helpful in shifting the balance from the sympathetic nervous system ( cues the body to prepare for fight - or - flight responses ) to the parasympathetic nervous system ( which is calming and restorative ). 

 Some of the ways that this calming response manifests physically are lower breathing and heart rate. Decreased blood pressure, lower cortisol levels, and increased blood flow to the intestines and vital organs. 

 Yoga is main goals are to achieve tranquility of the mind, create a sense of well - being, and increase self - confidence while lowering irritability. 

 The practice of yoga also optimizes the body is sympathetic responses to stressful stimuli. Reduces fear and aggression, and stimulates the pleasure centers in the median forebrain. 

 Yoga has been shown to be an effective tool in the management of depression. Studies have found that regular yoga practice leads to increases in serotonin levels and decreases in the levels of monamine oxidase and cortisol. 

 Yoga is a safe and natural way to help improve mood and reduce stress and anxiety. 












 Running Is Repetitive 

 Though your runs may feature ever - changing scenery, your body is doing the same thing over and over again mechanically – putting one foot in front of the other.  

 An average professional marathon runner, for instance, might take 25,000 steps, while an average runner needs 30,000 - 50,000. ( The formula to figure it out is 1661220 inches in a marathon divided by your stride length. ) 

 Whatever it is, it is a lot.  

 The high number of repetitions is relevant because they increase the likelihood of injury. 
 Yoga for Running Injury Prevention 

 Intuitively that makes sense. A car with 200,000 miles on it is more prone to breakdown compared to one with only 50,000. But what if you took care of the high mileage vehicle and drove the other car fast and furious all the time. Now which one is more likely to fail? 

 I bring this up because there is a lot you can do to prevent running injuries. How often you run is only part of the reason you might get injured. How you run and what else you do to support your running are more important, like adding yoga.  

 Running injuries focus heavily on legs, including the knees, IT band, shins, calves, hamstrings, and feet. Knowing this, you can adopt a preventative strategy and prepare your body for running by doing strength and mobility exercises. If this is your goal, choose a type of yoga with these components. ( See Best Yoga For Runners below ) 

 Think of yoga as a way to balance your body. It strengthens areas neglected by running, like your upper body, and provides variable movement to counteract running is repetition.  
 Benefits of Yoga For Runners 

 Instead of repackaging the entire litany of yoga is benefits, which you can read about here, I find it more helpful to tailor the benefits of yoga for runners. 

 That is, what yoga benefits are going to impact your running most.  

     Yoga Teaches Runners to Breath Better 
     Yoga Teaches Relaxation : The Key to Running Effortlessly 
     Yoga Teaches How to Be with Discomfort 

 Yoga Teaches Relaxation : The Key to Running Effortlessly 

 To our Western mind, being relaxed means we ’re on the couch scrolling through cat videos. 

 In the East, relaxation is power.  

 The opposite of relaxation is tension, and it is a problem because it costs you metabolic energy. You literally burn calories to support the tension in your body through muscular contractions. 

 In yoga, we embrace the paradox that relaxation and tension coexist. Think of it as where you ’re spending your energy. It is helpful to put energy in your legs, but not in your hands and face? 

 Yoga teaches you how to be with the paradox because yoga practitioners learn to do difficult things, like balancing on one foot, or holding a warrior stance, while relaxing.  

 Contrast this to a typical runner is approach, which is more about pushing. It is easy to spot runners who first come to yoga because they generally try to force their way into yoga poses.  

 It is a strategy that can succeed in running at first – go hard, go fast.  

 And it will work a short time in yoga – before it injures you. 
 Yoga A Balance of Tension and Relaxation 

 Pushing and using force can benefit some yoga poses, like holding a plank or a lunge.  

 But it will work against you in most other postures.  

 To the casual observer, yoga looks like you are doing a series of postures. The goal seems to be to get into as many yoga poses as you can. 

 But the yoga poses, or asanas, are simply a tool we use. They are the ball in soccer or the pieces in chess. It is how we use them that makes it yoga.  

 Take the notion of flexibility. A familiar yoga pose is standing forward fold. Many people will try to grab their legs and pull themselves down as hard as they can. That may strengthen your arms, but it predisposes your back to injury and does not do much for your hamstrings. 

 Instead, balance the tension, which is engaging your abdominals, quadriceps, and psoas to provide a stretch of your posterior chain, including your calves, hamstrings, glutes, and back.  

 Intelligently using tension can create strength and flexibility simultaneously. Therefore, this is a more effective way to practice yoga.  
 Yoga and Body Awareness for Runners 

 Working in this way also makes you more sensitive to what your body is doing, what we call body awareness.  

 As a runner, I use body awareness to tell me when I have adequately warmed up. For instance, I may be physically sweating, and my heart rate monitor may tell me I ’m in the training zone. However, if my outer knee feels a little off, I will extend the warm - up or even take it easy that day.  

 So again, yoga teaches you another way to engage with tension. This spawns such phrases as “ effortless effort ” and “ flow state. ”  

 Breathing well relaxes you, and it is one reason breath is so often brought up during yoga. 

 This is only one facet of relaxation, though. Another is how to relax when you ’re uncomfortable.  

 Yoga Teaches How To Be With Discomfort 

 Discomfort is another area where the Eastern and Western Minds diverge. 

 That is beginning to change, especially in areas around mental health and anxiety. However, there is still the prevailing view in society that we should try to avoid discomfort.  

 Yoga takes a different tack and actively embraces our uneasy feelings. 

 Runners know there are going to be some uncomfortable moments along the way. But, like their take on tension, many runners simply push through any unwanted sensations. They suck it up and go on.  

 But there is another, more effective way. 

 Yoga practitioners learn how to be comfortable with discomfort.  

 This is especially helpful for runners once you understand the concept behind it.  

 The Concept of Being with Discomfort 

 Point 1 

 The feeling of discomfort is not going to go away.  

 Point 2 

 But, you can get better at being with discomfort.  

 This first point recognizes that discomfort is part of reality. You ’re never going to banish it altogether. In fact, it is part of life. You eat breakfast, and you ’re hungry by lunch. Discomfort is something that is going to come up regularly. So let is learn to be with it. 

 The second point says you can get more comfortable being uncomfortable. And as you do, you can be with even more discomfort, which means you can do amazing things in life.  

 The default strategy in yoga is to befriend discomfort. You get to know it like having a conversation with a confidant instead of ignoring it and pretending it does not exist. You deal with the reality of discomfort.  

 If this sounds like mental gymnastics, it is. You can think of yoga as training your mind.  
 Yoga As Mental Training for Running 

 The differences that separate elite athletes from one another are primarily mental. It is why the field of sports psychology exists. 

 The conversation you have with discomfort is really a conversation between you and your mind, which is why it is such a powerful skill. 

 Many of our fears, worries, and doubts are remnants from long ago that just hang around. Often, they are no longer relevant.  

   concerns are things we have no control over but still expend enormous energy trying to.  

 However, there are things we can control. For example, we can relax when intense feelings come up and breathe in a slower, fuller manner. We can also discern between messages of discomfort. There are those rooted in the past and others that alert you to attend to something now. 

 In yoga, we learn this by watching our legs shake in a posture. We take the stance of the observer and watch how the feelings move within us and generate patterns of thinking. And we notice what intensifies sensations and what allows them to pass.  

 Being comfortable with discomfort gives you a more proactive way to work with stress, be it physical, mental or emotional.  

 The benefits of yoga for runners all work together. As you learn to breathe, it enhances your ability to relax. You can then take the skill of relaxation to work with discomfort. And all of these skills will make you a better runner.    

 Power Yoga 

 Power yoga gives runners more postural options and is a variable sequence type. Variable sequence practices mean the postures change from class to class. Typically a power yoga teacher will build a flow and then take you through that flow repeatedly.  

 Power yoga is characteristically heart - pounding and energetic. If you are looking for an alternative to running, this can be a good initial step. However, power yoga is not great at building strength. And the repetitions of a sequence are often described as feeling like you are “ going in circles. ” 











 hat is proprioception? Proprioception is a term you may have increasingly heard thrown around by doctors and health professionals when referring to ‘ body awareness ’ — but what exactly does it mean and how does it affect you? 

 It is often referred to as the body is sixth sense after sight, sound, smell, taste and touch. In short, it is a sense which helps inform your body where it is in space and the simplest example of it in action is when you close your eyes and touch your nose … after all, how does your finger know where your nose is? 

   familiar examples are when you play the piano ( without having to look at your hands on the keys ), throw a ball ( without having to look at your throwing arm ), and of course, practice yoga ( without having to constantly look at all of your limbs ). 

 Our bodies are full of sensory receptors called proprioceptors, which are found mainly in our muscles, tendons and skin. These sensory receptors receive stimuli from within our body that respond to position and movement. 

 Seasoned yogis have a highly developed sense of proprioception as it is a natural extension of being extremely aware of the body and its sensations. Practicing yoga requires proprioception as you move from pose to pose, maybe standing on one leg in warrior 3 and then opening your hips to the side, before transitioning into half moon and lifting your back leg up high. 

 You are effectively staying upright, whilst often balancing on one leg, stretching out your muscles, and moving your center of gravity around – without a sense of proprioception, you would certainly fall flat on your face ! 

 Examples of proprioception in yoga 
 Have you ever practiced a triangle pose and without thinking, by simply knowing where all your body parts are in relation to one another, automatically pulled your torso back in line with your hips, lengthened your spine, and stretched broadly across your chest? 

 This, here, is proprioception in action, as you sense your way into the correct alignment without going off balance. 

 A simpler example is when you step back from the front of your mat into a high lunge without looking down at your feet. Your body instinctively knows its location, movements and actions, which means you can confidently step back freely without falling over. 

 A different example is when you pick up a yoga block : you know roughly how much it weighs, thus the proprioceptors in your muscles will automatically know how much strength to use in order to lift it, and you do this without a second thought. 

 Every yoga pose will challenge your sense of proprioception to some degree. 

 Even in the poses which you find are more natural and easier to do, you can still experiment further by practicing in a new environment, on a different surface ( grass, sand, thick carpet ), or simply by closing your eyes. 

 How to improve your sense of proprioception 
 If you are new to yoga, you can start with a simple balancing pose such as tree pose, using props or a nearby wall to help you stay steady. If you are already comfortable with this, challenge yourself by looking up towards the ceiling, closing your eyes, or rotating your torso side to - side. 

 If you are more experienced with yoga, play around with arm balances such as crow pose or grasshopper pose, where you need to have particularly good control over both your strength and balance. 

 If arm balances are not for you, find a new yoga pose that you have not done before, which will test your muscles and what they already know. Alternatively, practice yoga in a new space that you are not familiar with, or on a contrasting surface to what you are normally used to, which will force your body to adjust. 

 Finally, maintaining your proprioception and sense of balance as you age is essential. If you are not convinced, according to Public Health England statistics, people aged 65 and over have the highest risk of falling, which can lead to serious injury or worse. The numerous balancing poses in yoga provide the perfect challenge for developing your proprioceptive receptors, which will help to keep you healthy and stable as you grow older. 












 Lighten Loads 

 If you have spent any significant time working to push your performance to the next level, you know that an occasional tweak will happen that creates some soreness with exercise. Usually, these tweaks though are nothing to worry about, and training can continue as normal. But what can you do when a more significant injury occurs? After months or years of hard work to improve your performance, you ca not just stop training during this injury. You need to continue training when injured to not only maintain your fitness ( strength, hypertrophy, endurance, etc. ) but to continue improving in whatever way possible. 

 Fortunately, some minor changes in your training plan can keep you training without exacerbating tissue healing timelines. Use these tactics as ideas to implement to continue training when injured ( not medical advice ). 
 Five Tactics To Continue Training When Injured 
 Limit Range of Motion 

 For many muscle and tendon injuries, pain and more damage can happen when the muscle is under tension in a stretched position. So in these conditions, limiting the range of motion can be a great way to continue training hard and heavy without slowing tissue healing. For example, in an athlete that has strained his or her pec muscle limiting the range of motion with an exercise such as a floor press instead of a bench press can often be enough to allow an athlete to push heavy weight without pain. 
 Deadlifts can be another example of this. Many athletes recovering from low back pain have difficulty pulling a barbell from the ground. But deadlifts are a great exercise to use when rehabbing from back pain. By elevating the bar a few inches off the ground can be a great tactic to continue pulling weight, building strength, and working the hip hinge pattern. 
 Use Exercise Variations 

 Small changes in the exercise variation we perform can be another great strategy for continued training when injured. Altering your grip, torso angles, knee positioning, etc. can change the amount of load placed on an injured joint or muscle. Let is use the squat as an example. The front squat typically has a more upright torso versus the back squat. For many athletes with hip or back pain, this slight change in set up can allow for pain - free training. 
 

 For athletes with shoulder pain, subtle changes such as changing your grip angle can have a positive impact. Switching to a neutral grip with a football bar or dumbbells rather than a barbell with exercises like the bench press or overhead press can very quickly change the pain you feel. 
 Unloaded Irritated Tissues 

 Sometimes we need to unload a tissue to avoid overstraining it completely. But we can use exercise variations to continue training the surrounding muscles to continue to improve their strength. For example, in someone with low back pain not tolerating compressive loading very well or a post - op shoulder, barbell squat variations may not be possible. The belt squat is one great option to continue loading the legs without risking these healing tissues in other areas. 

 A banded hip hinge movement is another excellent example of how we can unload the spine while still pushing leg loading. Place a resistance band around the hips to resist hip extension. As the individual becomes more tolerant of spinal loading, they can add external resistance with barbells or dumbbells to challenge the hips and spine while decreasing the band resistance. 

 I know that we all want to train hard and heavy. But at times, we ca not push maximal loads. If we have to lift lighter weights, we simply push up the volume to similar to what we would program in a hypertrophy block. As the injured tissues heal and tolerate heavier loading, we decrease the volume and increase the weight. Here is an example of how we might progress that over several weeks : 

     1st Week : 3×25 
     2nd Week : 3×20 
     3rd Week : 3×15 
     4th Week : 5×10 
     5th Week : 5×8 
     6th Week : 5×5 

 
 Train Contralateral 

 In extreme situations, an area may not be able to be loaded at all. The best example of this would be after an orthopedic surgery, we frequently have sutures holding tissues together. If overloaded, the repaired tissues will fail, so we have minimal options for training that area. 

 In this case, we are going to push training the uninjured side as muscle as possible because research has shown that this helps us maintain strength and muscle mass on the injured extremity. While many fear that doing this will create a deficit in side to side strength or muscle mass, the opposite appears correct, we will decrease the amount of fitness we lose. Once the healing process progresses, we can begin using some of the above strategies to begin rebuilding fitness. 









  

 Unfortunately, things can happen in life or sport that result in an injury. Injuries are a frustrating time for obvious reasons, but if you think that an injury means you must stop training, think again ! 

 If for example you have a fracture in your left arm, you can certainly continue to exercise in the gym. You can strength train your lower body and undertake cycling ( or other forms of cardiovascular exercise ). 

 Another important rehabilitation strategy when you have one side injured is to complete unilateral ( one sided ) weight training on your opposite ( uninjured ) side. People often neglect training the uninjured side which is has shown to increase recovery ! 
 But will not training only one side result in significant muscular imbalance? 

 According to numerous studies, no. 

 In fact, research has shown that correctly tailored exercise has not only been shown to strengthen the uninvolved side but maintain strength and sometimes even muscle mass in the injured limb ! 

 Resistance training is a powerful stimulus for neuromuscular adaptation. ( 1 ) These adaptations are not limited to the working muscle and have in fact been shown to result in increases in strength and neural drive in a contralateral, resting muscle. ( 1 ) 

 The phenomenon resulting in this sparing ’ of strength and size on an uninvolved limb is termed ‘ cross - education. ’ ( 1, 2 ) This has been demonstrated in numerous studies : 

 They conducted a study on 16 participants whereby the nondominant forearm was immobilized in a cast, while participants were either assigned to an exercising group ( eccentric wrist flexion, 3x / week ) or a control group ( no exercise ) for 4 weeks. ( 2 ) The study found that the resistance training group maintained not only strength, but also muscle cross sectional area of the wrist flexors in the immobilized limb. ( 2 ) 

 Furthermore,   and colleagues conducted a similar study, this time testing the effect of exercise on quadriceps strength and muscle activation in an uninvolved limb. ( 3 ) The exercising group exercised their uninjured limb 3x / week for 8 weeks and the study again concluded that greater strength and activation occurred in the unexercised limb in the exercising group when compared to the control group. Similarly, a study conducted tested the effect of unilateral training to either the left or right leg in 20 previously untrained individuals. ( 4 ) The study was conducted over 10 weeks ( 34 sessions ) of single - leg exercise completing both the leg press and leg extension. ( 4 ) Similarly, this study also concluded that the 10 - week program resulted in a significant increase in both maximal strength and muscle size in the untrained leg, again demonstrating a cross - education effect. ( 4 ) 

 Hence, the research demonstrates the benefits that training an uninjured limb can have on the injured limb. When you are injured, it is important that you continue with a structured strength training program as your recovery outcomes are better. 

 Injuries can be a frustrating and demotivating time, especially if you let them keep you away from training.    A tailored exercise routine during a time of injury can still benefit you ! 

 At Inspire Fitness for Well being we adopt this with many of our members in order to keep them on track to achieve their goals. We do this through our design of individually tailored exercise programs that can be shaped around a potential injury, in order to keep you active and improving your overall health and well-being. 










 “ I have injured my “ insert body part ” what can I do? ” This is the question most people face when injured, and let is firstly state the answer is NOT just rest ! We have previously discussed the benefits of beginning rehabilitation ASAP on the injured site ( see blog here ), but what if I told you that training your uninjured side can result in strength gains on your injured side? 

 Researchers from the University of Copenhagen studied the effects of disuse on muscle strength, and revealed in their younger subjects that two weeks inactivity resulted in a staggering 33 % loss in leg strength, leaving them on par with a person who is 40 - 50 years their senior ! And if this is not shocking enough, it can take 2 - 3 times as long to regain this lost strength ! 

 Fortunately, we have something called the cross - education effect that we can take advantage of !   The cross - education effect is a phenomenon whereby training one side of the body results in an increased strength of the OPPOSITE side of the body. This effect was first observed and published in the literature over 100 years ago, and since this time there have been hundreds of studies examining this topic. 

 What sort of gains can we experience from this cross - education effect? 

 The size of contralateral strength gains varies based on the length and type of training, but a 2018 meta - analysis by       revealed a strength gain of : 

     18 % in young, able - bodied adults 

     15 % in older, able - bodied participants, 

     29 % in a patient population consisting of post stroke, neuromuscular disorders, and osteoarthritis patients. 

 This is quite staggering considering this represents 52 - 80 % of the gains in the trained limb, and it is not even being used ! These effects do not seem to be limited to a single muscle group or area ; benefits have been seen all over the body. 

 How does it happen, and how can we maximize it? 

 As yet, researchers have not reached a consensus on the exact mechanisms of effect, but the leading theory is that the strength gains on the untrained side are neurally driven. It is theorized that the cross - over effect is perhaps the body is attempt to strive for symmetry 

 A study examined training parameters ( sets / reps / contraction type ) that might maximize the cross - education effect.   They found that performing 3 - 5 sets of 8 - 15 repetitions of eccentric contractions with rest times of 1 - 2 minutes between sets, created the greatest change. they also found that higher - load and more cognitively demanding strength training, such as using a metronome to control movement, increases cross - education. 

 Potential uses of the cross - education effect 

 ANY injury that results in an inability to perform your usual resistance training. Some examples of its ’ use could include : 

     Shoulder pain, and only able to perform 50 % of your usual bench press and overhead press? Switch to dumbbells, continue training the uninjured side at 100 %, and do what you can perform on the injured side 

     Broken leg and in a cast for 6 weeks? Switch to single - leg weights for the uninjured side i.e. leg press, leg extension, leg curl, split squat, calf raise, to slow the decline in strength of the injured leg. 

     Acute flare - up of knee osteoarthritis? Train the other leg to take advantage of a 29 % gain ! 

     Shoulder or ACL reconstruction? Early in the rehab process whilst not able to do much on the operated side, keep training the opposite side ! 

 Conclusion 

     An injury is not an excuse to stop training 

     Do not neglect the uninjured side, use unilateral training to take advantage of the cross - education effect. 

     Cross - education can result in a staggering 18 - 29 % gain in strength of the opposite side 

     3 - 5 sets of 8 - 15 reps of eccentric contractions with rest times of 1 - 2 minutes between sets, and also using a metronome when performing may result in a greater change. 










 If you have ever dealt with an injury before running in a race or another sporting event, you have probably wondered whether it is safe to continue exercising and training. Although staying less active during recovery can be difficult, exercising while injured can hinder your healing. Here is what you need to know about exercising while dealing with a sports injury. 
 What is a sports injury? 

 “ Sports injuries happen as a result of exercise or other physical activity,." “ They have numerous causes, including overuse, improper technique and a sudden impact. ” Sports injuries range from minor strains and sprains to more severe conditions, like fractures or tears. While they can occur in any part of the body, sports injuries are most common in the knees, ankles and shoulders. 
 Can I exercise while injured? 

 Determining whether you can exercise while injured depends on the type and severity of your injury. Mild injuries like sprains or strains may allow for low - impact exercises such as cycling or swimming. However, injuries like fractures or torn ligaments require plenty of rest and proper medical attention. 

 “ Before engaging in physical activity after a sports injury, make sure your pain, swelling and stiffness are significantly improved, ” said Cartwright. “ Pushing yourself too hard or too soon can exacerbate your injury and slow recovery. ” Talk to your doctor about a recovery plan and identifying safe exercises while your body heals. 
 How can I recognize my limits and exercise safely while injured? 

 The best way to stay safe is to pay attention to your body and how it feels. If you experience pain or discomfort during or after exercising, it may be a sign you ’re overdoing it. Start with low - impact exercises, like cycling, walking, swimming or yoga, and gradually increase the intensity as your injury heals. 

 “ Do not train through pain. If there is pain in the range of motion for that exercise, try decreasing the weight or reducing the range of motion. If neither technique works, then skip that exercise all together, ” said Cartwright. “ Talk to your doctor or physical therapist to help determine which exercises and activities are safe for you while your body heals. ” 
 How can I find the motivation to exercise through an injury? 

 It can be challenging to stay motivated while injured, but there are things you can do to help. “ Set realistic goals for yourself and celebrate small victories, ” said Cartwright. “ Even low - impact exercises can help you maintain your fitness level and heal from injury. ” Finding an exercise buddy or joining a support group is a great way to keep you accountable and motivated as you regain your footing.  
 What are some tips for preventing sports injuries in the future? 

 Always warm up and stretch before exercising, which increases blood flow and flexibility and minimizes the risk of injury and joint pain. Using proper technique and form helps you move more efficiently and lowers your risk of injury. Wear appropriate gear and equipment for your workout and stay hydrated throughout. Gradually increase the intensity and duration of your exercise sessions and take rest days to allow your body to recover. 











 However, it is important to understand the difference between pushing through the pain and further injuring yourself. In fact, recent studies have shown that the most common cause of injuries in fitness facilities was from overexertion. 

 If you are injured and looking to stay in shape, keep reading this guide to discover seven of the best exercises to do while recovering from injuries. 
 1. Swimming & Pool Workouts 

 Swimming pool workouts can be a great way to exercise while being injured. Working out in the pool is low impact and fun way to burn calories. 

 Who does not love enjoying a refreshing pool while working out? There are many different workouts that you can perform in the pool that will give you that sense of accomplishment without straining yourself. 

 Typical pool workouts include : 

     Arms lifts 
     Jumping jacks 
     Leg kicks 
     Lateral raises 
     And walking 

 Exercising in the pool provides an opportunity for full - body workouts while limiting the impact you experience. 

 2. Resistance Bands 

 Looking to keep the blood flowing while injured? 

 Resistance bands offer a way of isolating specific muscles so you can work around injuries and strengthen the muscles around injuries to ensure they will not be lingering around. 

 These bands are very inexpensive and can be used for many different exercises. 
 3. Stretching 

 If you are experiencing sprains or strains, stretching may not be the best idea for you. 

 However, if you are experiencing muscle tightness, stretching can help loosen those muscles and prevent further injuries. 

 Stretching should be a significant factor in your weekly workout schedule, as it can help keep muscles strong and flexible. 

 You can also incorporate yoga into your daily routine for added benefits, just be sure to stick to basic poses to avoid further injuries. 
 4. Stationary Bike 

  

 If you have any upper body injuries, hopping on a stationary bike can provide a great cardio workout session without promoting injuries. 
 5. Balancing Exercises 

 Working on your balance is another essential aspect of exercise that many people overlook. 

 Working on balancing exercises like one leg stands can help reduce the risk of injuries while and will help the recovery process with existing injuries. 
 6. Walking 

 Walking is often overshadowed by other types of exercise. However, walking is one of the most effective ways of working out and staying in shape. 

 There have been several studies conducted that imply walking is the best thing to do to improve your overall health. 











 Focus on getting better overall. “ Use your recovery as an opportunity to work on other aspects of your fitness, to challenge your body in a different way, ” he says. “ Ultimately, it will help you do your favorite activities even better. ” 

 Here is how to get back to exercising after an injury. 
 1. Do check in with your doctor for a game plan. 

 First things first : If you have a persistent injury that you have not yet seen a doctor for, that is step one. “ The most important thing to do after an injury is to get the right diagnosis for treatment and a recovery plan, ” doctor says. He explains that he customizes treatments and recovery programs based on his patients ’ injuries and sports of choice. “ Every injury is unique, and there are different demands on your body based on the activities you ’re involved in. I will not give the same advice to an equestrian that I would give to a soccer player, even for the same kind of knee injury. ” 
 2. Do not rush back too quickly. 

 If you were off for a week because of a shoulder injury, plan to take two weeks to get back to where you were before the injury, According to doctor, your recovery should last twice as long as the time that your injury kept you out of commission. “ If you were off for a week because of a shoulder injury, plan to take two weeks to get back to where you were before the injury, ” he says. 

 Keep in mind that the period in which you were not able to exercise or participate in sports affected more than just the injured area. “ After a break, you lose strength, coordination and flexibility — not only where you were injured but also elsewhere in your body, ” doctor says. That deconditioning, combined with adjusting your movements to compensate for weaker or painful areas, is how many people get hurt. “ It is common to come back from an injury and then get an injury in a different spot, ” he says. “ People with a hurt right knee will put more weight on their left side, for instance. That sets you up for another injury. ” 
 3. Do start with small goals. 

 A journey of 1,000 miles starts with a single step — so do yourself a favor and make it a small one. “ Go gradually, with the aim of slowly getting back to normal, ” doctor says. Start with some easy stretching and strength training. “ There are a variety of things you can do to regain flexibility and range of motion, ” he adds, like Pilates or yoga. If you ’re working out at home, try some flexibility training with dynamic ( active ) stretching. 

 As for strengthening, doctor advises starting with bodyweight or band exercises, cable machines or light weights. “ Avoid Olympic weights and bench presses, ” he says. “ Increase your strength without loading your body too much. Then gradually work your way up to more weight. ” 
 4. Do not ignore pain. 

 Though we may enjoy the physical and mental challenges of being uncomfortable when we exercise, post - injury is not the time to push through pain. “ Do not be a hero, ” doctor says. “ Rehab is not the time to push it — do not ignore pain, discomfort or other reactions in your body. ” 

 Check in with your body before you exercise. “ I tell patients that they need to have normal function for daily activities before they start exercising, ” he says. “ If you twinged your knee, and it hurts when you ’re doing the dishes or walking up and down stairs, it is going to hurt if you go for a four - mile run. Make sure you have no pain and full range of motion before loading the joint again. And if you ’re feeling discomfort two days after exercise, or persisted through an activity despite pain, you have pushed too hard. Cut back on the effort. ” 
 5. Do get back to what you love, once you ’re ready. 

 Ultimately, you want to return to the exercises and activities you love — and you should ! Once you ’re pain - free, hit the courts or links for some limited play. “ If you play tennis, for example, start with a few ground strokes — but no serves, ” doctor says. “ See how you ’re feeling during and after. The next time you go out, work the baseline a bit, maybe hit a couple serves. Work your way into it. Next time out, play a few points — a game or two. Then, by all means, test it out and play a match. ” 

 Similarly, if your sport of choice is golf, start with chipping and putting. “ Then play nine, ” he says. “ If that feels OK, go ahead and play 18 next time. ” 

 “ You want a nice, gradual return, ” doctor says. “ That is how the pros do it. The skills will come back. ” 











  Injury vs. Soreness 

 While it is, of course, important to listen to your body, it is possible that you may think you have an injury when you 're really just sore, which may affect what is safe to do in terms of exercise. 

 Some pain after exercise is to be expected, especially when you 're first getting started. Delayed onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) comes on a day or two after a workout. When DOMS sets in, you might be worried you have an injury, but this soreness is usually your body is response to a new kind of exercise, an especially hard workout, or working out when you 're not warmed up enough. 

 DOMS can usually be treated with anti - inflammatory medication, rest, and something to soothe your muscles, like a hot bath. Exercise usually need not be limited for safety reasons if you want to keep active, though it may be uncomfortable and rest may be just what you need to get the most out of your next workout.1 

 DOMS can also be a sign you 're headed for something more serious than post - workout aches. If the pain is new, continues despite treatment, or gets worse, you could be dealing with an injury. 
 Exercising With an Injury 

 When you do have a true injury, what is advisable will entirely depend on your case. Before continuing or starting a workout plan, see a healthcare practitioner to make sure your injury is promptly diagnosed and treated. Then you can work with the provider to find a routine that promotes healing but does not risk making the injury worse. Know, however, that some injuries may call for you to take a break from activity altogether. 
 Listen to Your Health Care Provider 

 Your health care provider is advice about exercising with an injury will depend on the location, nature, severity of the injury, as well as your overall health. 

 Your health care provider may recommend that you swap the exercises you currently do for new ones, continue with your routine in a modified way ( e.g., use lighter weights or work in more rest days ), or even stop certain types of activities entirely until your condition improves.2 

 Your health care provider can help guide a resistance training program to help you stay strong while you 're recovering. In addition to making recommendations about activities, he or she may refer you to a physical therapist who can suggest exercises to both heal your injury and help strengthen the rest of your body. 

 Whatever your health care provider or physical therapist recommends, it is advisable to heed the advice. Aim to do the exercises they give you for as long as they recommend. 
 Modify Wisely 

 If you have a knee injury, for example, your health care provider may advise you to avoid cardio or lower - body strength routines. However, unless your health care provider notes otherwise, you can still work on your upper body. Try switching to a sit - down workout routine. Think of it as a challenge to figure out how to exercise while seated or laying down, as this will not put pressure on the injured joint or muscle. 

 Likewise, if you have an upper - body injury, such as your shoulder or elbow, try concentrating on lower - body exercises while you heal. You can also modify your routine by skipping exercises that require you to use the injured part of your body. If you have injured your arm, for example, do not use hand weights for a few days. 

 If your lower body is hurt, swap out the treadmill or leg machines for those that focus on upper - body strength. Again, take cues from your doctor and/or physical therapist as to what is best for your situation. 
 Do not Work Through the Pain 

 Resist the temptation to jump back into your normal routine, even if you 're feeling better. Stop if you feel pain in the injured part of your body or somewhere new — even if it happens when you 're doing the exercises your doctor or physical therapist recommended. 

 If the pain is getting worse or you develop new pain, talk to your doctor or physical therapist. If pain continues or starts while you 're on a modified workout, you may be able to address it by simply moving on to a different exercise. However, in some cases, it may be best to simply stop — especially if the injury is making it difficult to use proper form. 

 Falling out of the correct form does not just make the exercise less effective, it also puts you at risk for further injury. 
 Give Yourself Time to Recover 

 Skipping a workout to let your body heal from an injury can be frustrating, but pressing on can prolong a full recovery and worsen your injury. If your healthcare provider recommends rest, take this seriously. Rest when your body tells you it needs to. 

  Some injuries may be supported by using a wrap, brace, or splint. It is important that any supportive device you wear fits properly. Ask your doctor, physical therapist, or trainer for recommendations. 

 As you return to exercise, you may need to dial back the intensity or frequency of your regular routine to give your body enough time to recover between sessions. 
 Prevent Future Injuries 

 Taking some time to assess your routine and identify why the injury occurred will help you prevent future injuries. Consider why you may have sustained an injury and make any modifications you feel are necessary ; a personal trainer can help with making these calls. 

 Perhaps a spotter could have helped you avoid injury by monitoring your workout and actively ensuring your safety with weights. You also want to avoid pushing yourself too hard or too far past your current limits. A proper warm - up and correct form also precautions you can take to help prevent and avoid injury. 

 Take a close look at the types of exercises you do too ; you might be giving too much attention to one area of your body. Cross training is an important aspect of a well - rounded exercise routine. Make sure you 're rotating through several forms of exercise that strengthen different areas. 

 While an injury is never desired, it can remind you of a few important lessons : 

     Avoid overtraining : When your muscles are tired, they ca not support and protect your ligaments and tendons. Weak muscles can lead to overtraining injuries. Give yourself regular rest and recovery days.4 
     Maintain flexibility and balance : Tight muscles cause imbalances that can lead to injuries. For example, if your quadriceps ( front of the leg ) are stronger than your hamstrings ( back of the leg ), you 're at risk for straining or evening rupturing your hamstrings. 
     Strengthen your whole body : Make sure you incorporate regular weight training into your weekly routine. Strengthening all muscle groups reduces imbalances that case other muscles to overcompensate. 











  While the physical aspects of taking time off can be tough, the emotional aspect of feeling sidelined is the biggest challenge. " Most media coverage highlights the physical benefits of exercising frequently, but we also experience an enormous emotional benefit. " 

 The mental health benefits of exercise include less stress, higher confidence, and even better creativity. And while it takes two to four weeks to lose strength and conditioning, the mental impact of removing exercise from your routine happens almost immediately. 

 That said, having a plan for when you need to take some time off can make your life a lot easier. Here is what rehab pros recommend doing to care for both your mental and physical health when you 're dealing with an injury. 
 How to Train If You 're Injured 
 If you 're sidelined for a day or two... 

 The mental : Use your time off wisely. 

 Missing a workout or two is a bummer, but it is important to remind yourself it is not the end of the world.  One of the best tools you can use, she says, is positive self - talk. Telling yourself something like, " It is temporary, I can deal with it " or " I 'm still strong " can go a long way toward putting things in perspective. 

 Aside from that, try using the time productively to plan your next training session, reach out to others who you know have dealt with similar injuries to get their advice, or connect with a physical therapist or trainer to learn about how to prevent the injury you 're currently dealing with. 

 To replace the mental release you get from your workouts, try using relaxation methods like meditation and progressive muscle relaxation, suggests Marks. 

 The physical : Treat it as recovery time. 

 Luckily, taking a day or two off from exercise is no big deal, even if it is unplanned. " I think it is important to think of a few days off as crucial to rehab a minor injury — not only to prevent a more significant injury that would result in even more missed time — but also as the recovery that is important for performance, " says Lou. 

 " A lot of athletes think about training as making gains and rest as missed gains, but it is not completely true. The body needs rest and recovery in order to maximize the benefit from training and working out. " Simply think of this time as some extra rest and recovery so you can crush your next workout when you 're feeling better. 
 If you 're sidelined for a week or two... 

 The mental : See it as an opportunity to cross - train. 

 Taking a week or two off from your workout of choice is not ideal. " It can be really tough mentally for athletes and people who love to work out to be sidelined for a chunk of time, " says Lou. But there is a simple way to make yourself feel productive : " This is a great time to cross - train or to make time to train a specific strength or skill that will help with overall performance goals but gets forgotten during periods of training. " 

 For example : If you 're a weightlifter and you have injured your wrist, maybe now is a good time to do some cardio workouts you would not normally have time for. Or if you 're a runner with a sprained ankle, you could work on upper body strength and core strength in the weight room. Whatever you decide to do, it is critical to set specific and achievable goals to stay focused and motivated, says Lou. 

 The physical : Fix the problem. 

 If you 're forced to take time off for more than a few days for a non - acute injury, it usually means your body is trying to tell you something. " In my opinion, it is most important to understand that you ca not build strength on an injury and without proper healing time." 

 " Most importantly, you should never ignore pain, " she says. " Pain is the way your body communicates that you are at risk for an injury. " Provided you do not have a traumatic injury, like a broken bone or wound, pain that is preventing you from working out usually means your body has been compensating for weakness" " You should not just focus on the pain, but rather on addressing the cause of the pain. " 

 Some smart ways to do this include self - myofascial release through foam rolling, using a lacrosse or tennis ball on tender areas, and doing gentle exercises that avoid the injured area. If you 're not sure what to do, it is a good idea to check in with a physical therapist. 
 If you 're sidelined for a month or two ( or longer )... 

 The mental : Stay positive, ask for support, and take action. 

 " Significant time off can be psychologically and emotionally distressing, " says Marks. Four crucial things to keep in mind : 

     Mental health is equally important to physical recovery. 
     Social support is key. 
     You ca not get back to full fitness on your will alone, but a positive outlook has been shown to significantly aid recovery. 
     You can do something every day to work toward rehabilitation. 

 " Taking action, even simply by doing PT exercises or cooking a healthy meal, can reduce feelings of powerlessness and low self - esteem while simultaneously contributing to physical recovery, " she adds. ( Experts also recommend incorporating anti - inflammatory foods into your healthy meals when you 're healing from an injury. 

 The physical : Ask for an alternative. 

 If you 're going to be out of commission for a significant chunk of time, a good physical therapist will provide you with alternatives and substitutions to your usual workout. 

 Unless you have an injury that affects your whole body, there is almost always something else you can do to stay active. " Walking, swimming, and yoga are great general choices but nearly any workout can be modified around pain with the right strategy, " he adds. With the help of a professional, you can work toward maintaining strength and conditioning, so that you 're ready to get back into action when the time comes. ( You should also work on your mobility to prevent future injuries. ) 











 Yoga And Stretching For Injury Prevention And Rehabilitation 

 Strength, active flexibility, balance, and coordination for reducing injuries 

 Soft tissue ( joints, muscles, connective tissue ) injuries happen when the outside force exceeds the force your body can generate in return. 
 Strength 

 The stronger your muscles are, the more stable your joints become, directly reducing the likelihood of injuries. Strong muscles can withstand more physical stress and protect your joints by absorbing the impact that might otherwise strain them. 
 Active flexibility 

 The way active flexibility plays a crucial role in reducing the risk of injuries is quite similar to strength. Active flexibility means you have the necessary strength and control of your joint is range of motion. 

 Unlike passive flexibility, where an external force is used to achieve a stretch, active flexibility requires your muscular effort. Which in turn helps protect the joint against outside forces. 

 Active flexibility also enhances your body is proprioceptive abilities, which is knowing where your body parts are in space. As a result, your movements become more controlled and less likely to go beyond safe limits, thereby preventing strains, sprains, and other injuries. 

 Balance 

 Balance is all about maintaining your body is moving or stationary position. Having a good balance means your body can redistribute your weight according to your movements, which helps you avoid falls and stumbles that could lead to injuries. 

 A balanced and strong body is also adept at reacting to changes in terrain or direction, which is crucial for avoiding missteps that could lead to sprained ankles or similar injuries. 
 Coordination 

 Coordination is the ability of your body parts to work in unison to execute a movement smoothly. Similarly to balance, coordination helps you avoid missteps that might put your joints in positions where they ca not react quickly enough to counteract the outside force. 

 Yoga and stretching can help us reduce injuries and aid recovery. But the benefits that each practice delivers are different. 
 How yoga can reduce the risk of injuries and aid the rehab 

 Although yoga is main aim is to help the practitioner attain harmony and better understand themselves, the physical aspect can also help with injury reduction and recovery. 

 Regularly practicing yoga can improve your strength, balance, and coordination. But yoga alone is not enough to build the strength needed to significantly reduce the risk of injuries. For that purpose, strength training and active stretching are more effective. 

 Nevertheless, like any movement, yoga can help restore the range of motion after an injury. 

 Perhaps the greatest benefit yoga can offer for reducing and rehabbing injuries is how it helps reduce stress and anxiety. We know that high levels of unmanaged stress and anxiety can reduce pain tolerance and slow recovery after an injury. 

 Lower levels of stress and anxiety also help you sleep better, allowing the body to recover. Both when recovering when injured, but also to simply recover between workouts. 
 How stretching can reduce the risk of injuries and aid the rehab 

 Active stretching is your best bet for reducing the risk of injury. Unlike passive stretching, active stretching helps to strengthen your muscles. And the stronger your muscles, the less susceptible they are to injury. 

 And if you do get injured, the strength you have built with active stretching and strength training will likely reduce the severity of the injury. 

 Moreover, stretching, like yoga, can help restore the range of motion after an injury, making it an integral part of your rehabilitation process. But again, active stretching takes the cake over passive stretching and yoga for restoring the range of motion. 










 Which muscle injuries can you stretch? 

 The first thing to understand is which muscle injuries are OK for stretching and which are not. Two of the most common muscle injuries for young athletes are : 

     Muscle strain : stretching or tearing of muscle fibers 
     Muscle contusion ( also called a muscle bruise ): injury to muscle fibers, connective tissue or blood vessels usually from a direct blow 

 Stretching can help you heal from a muscle strain, as long as it is not severe. Stretching can also help when healing a new muscle contusion. For example, our athletic trainers often recommend simultaneously icing and stretching quad contusions right after the injury. 
 What is a muscle strain? 

 Also known as a pulled or torn muscle, a muscle strain is when the muscle fibers pull apart from each other and are damaged. This can come from putting too much weight on the muscle, overuse or fatigue, an accident or using the muscle incorrectly. The right stretch at the right time is a key component in that treatment plan. 

 Stretching is not only important to prevent further injury and scar tissue, but also helps a newly injured muscle lengthen to release the body is natural response to spasm. Young athletes can often pull a muscle by doing exercises incorrectly or during their sport.  
 The dos of stretching a newly injured muscle 

 The most important thing to pay attention to is the kind of pain you ’re feeling. 

 “ A good indicator when it is OK to begin gentle stretching is when the pain in the injured area has shifted from sharp or stabbing to more of a soreness or stiffness, ” says. “ You should not start until that happens. ” 

 When stretching a newly injured muscle, it will help if you : 

     Do wait three days to a week after the injury, depending on severity and symptoms, to begin stretching. Using pain as a guide ; if you feel sharp pain in the injured area, it means it is too early to start stretching. 
     Do wait until the inflammation mostly goes away before the first stretch. 
     Do start with gentle static stretching – reach and hold rather than doing movement - based stretching. 
     Do ensure the stretching is mostly pain - free to help the healing process. 
     Do incorporate a consistent dynamic warm - up routine and include static stretching after an activity to prevent soreness and improve flexibility. 

  

 Timing is everything when it comes to what you should not do when stretching an injured muscle. If your muscle is not relaxed, it can affect the muscles around it. 

 “ Stretching before the muscle can relax is setting yourself up for further injury ”. 

 When stretching a newly strained muscle : 

     Do not necessarily use the rest, ice, compress and elevate ( RICE ) method right away to begin healing a strained muscle. He explains that using ice later to alleviate some spasms can help but slapping on ice right after an injury can actually increase healing time. Compression and rest can be helpful in a newly strained muscle depending on the severity of the injury. 
     Do not push your stretch “ just a little bit farther ” than comfortable. This can delay the healing process. 
     Do not wait too long to begin stretching. For a minor strain that may be just a few days. For a moderate strain that could be 1 to 2 weeks and for a severe strain that could extend to 2 to 6 weeks. Waiting too long can create scar tissue, reducing flexibility and strength. 
     Do not immediately return to Understanding what your body needs most, regardless of severity, is the most important aspect of stretching and healing an injured muscle. You should be pain free, back to full strength and flexibility and have completed a slow ramp - up of activity to ensure the area does not feel aggravated. 










  If you have a sports injury, chances are you will need to take some time off to rest, recover, and regroup. But if you do not want to stop all exercise, there are ways to maintain base fitness while recovering from many sports injuries. 
 Maintaining Your Fitness Base 

 Athletes who are injured often worry about losing fitness during time away from training. Detraining or deconditioning is a fact of life when you stop exercise, but if you simply want to maintain a base of fitness, there are a few ways to stay active. 

 You can maintain your fitness level even if you need to change or cut back on your exercise for several months. In order to do so, you need to exercise at about 70 percent of your VO2 max at least once per week. 

 Before you do any exercise after an injury, it is wise to get the approval and recommendations of your treating physician or therapist. Follow their recommendations about when you can resume exercise, how much, and what type of exercise is best.1﻿ 
 Returning to Exercise After an Injury 

 Even if one body part or joint is immobilized, there is usually no reason that you ca not find other ways to stay fit while rehabilitating by using the principles of cross - training. It may take some creativity and the flexibility to try new things, but most athletes find training through injury is possible and not terribly difficult. 

 The key is to maintain the right attitude and remain active within your tolerance until your injury is healed. Here are some ways to continue working out while recovering from four common injuries. 
 Ankle and Foot Injuries 

 If your ankle or foot is injured, you still have many exercise options. If your doctor approves it and you are able to, try using the rowing machine, a stationary bike with one leg, or swimming. Work with your doctor or trainer to find other non - weight bearing cardio exercises you can do and spend 30 to 60 minutes about three times a week on that exercise to maintain endurance. 

  Leg and Knee Injuries 

 Leg and knee injuries can be fairly limiting for most athletes. Almost all endurance exercise requires flexion and extension of the knee joint, so developing a new routine may be frustrating. One - legged cycling, kayaking, or using an upper - body ergometer ( hand cycle ) are options. Swimming may be possible if you use a pull buoy so you do not kick or use your legs. 

  Elbow and Shoulder Injuries 

 Shoulder or other upper body injuries often allow the most possibility for continuing traditional cardio exercise because the lower body can be exercised fully. Walking, stair climbing, stationary ( hands - free ) cycling, and the elliptical trainer are all possibilities. 












 The pain and trauma of getting hurt is bad enough. Then you have to recover, which likely means that you 're taking time off from your standard routine of physical training, curtailing whatever goals you were striving to achieve. But just because you 're hurt, that does not mean you need to shut down your training completely until your injury fully heals. You just have to understand how to work smart around your limitations. 

 If approached properly — and with your doctor is approval, importantly — there are still ways to move forward with your training plan while you 're recovering from an injury. 
 Ground Rules for Working Out With an Injury 

 Before you go all in, just remember two ground rules : 
 Listen to Your Doctor 

 Whether you ’re recovering from surgery or other type of traumatic injury, the body needs to heal. Your physician is the best source for getting you back to 100 percent. 
 Remember Your Limits 

 Take a little off the top when it comes to volume and load. You ’re still in the healing process. Now is the time to make some adjustments while still being able to train hard. 

 Once you check those boxes, it is time adjust your training plan by incorporating these three rules for wise and effective training through an injury. You will still make gains, even while you 're in a little bit of pain. “ You will convert that injury into an opportunity, ”   says. “ We 're not only going to build muscle right now, but we 're going to set ourselves up for greater gains in the future. ” 
 3 Rules for Training While Injured 
 Focus on Isolation Exercises 

 Normally compound moves are the way to go when muscle building is your goal, but if you have one limb out of commission, it is ideal to reduce the tension in that area as much as possible. The best way to do this is with isolation exercises. For example, if heavy deadlifts and squats are no longer an option, attack your lower body with moves such as leg extensions and calf raises. 
 Train the Healthy Parts of Your Body 

 If you 're worried about looking like an unbalanced weirdo after training only one side of your body, relax. You ’re not going to end up with a mismatched arm or leg sizes if you shift your focus to one side of your body — that is a fitness myth. Actually research says the opposite : Training your healthy side while your other side is recovering can actually help you avoid losing muscle on the injured limb. So, using unilateral training, it is OK — even encouraged — to attack that side heavy no matter the exercise, from presses to rows. Load up and go. 











 Differentiating Soreness from Pain 

 Soreness is almost to be expected during rigorous activity, especially if you have not exercised in a while or you have recently increased the intensity of your workout. This sore or achy feeling is a result of micro - tears or mild inflammation in your muscles or tendons, which is normal. The muscle repairs the tears while you ’re resting, and it helps the muscle to grow in size and strength. 

 You may even feel like your soreness does not appear until hours or days after the activity.   says this phenomenon is called Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness ( DOMS ) and it usually starts 24 hours following the activity, resolving in, at the most, seven days. 

 It is alright to exercise if you ’re experiencing soreness, and physical activity might actually help alleviate the ache. But says any soreness lasting longer than a week is not normal and should be followed up on with your primary care physician. 

 “ If you begin to experience chest pain or shortness of breath while working out, this is a sign to stop what you are doing and call your doctor as well, ” she adds. “ Another thing to look out for is extreme soreness, tight / hard muscles, numbness, tingling and dark - colored urine. These symptoms can be due to muscle breakdown and a rare condition called rhabdomyolysis which warrants a trip to the emergency room ! ” 

 While experiencing sore muscles is normal, pain is not. Pain represents injury ; it is our body is way of letting us know something is not right. Pain during or after exercise can be a sign of overuse or too much stress placed on a muscle or tendon. When it is a result of repetitive use or a single episode of overloading a muscle or tendon, it is referred to as a muscle strain. 

 “ Pushing through sharp, acute pain could be causing more damage than good taking away the initial benefit of exercise, ”   explains. “ If your soreness turns into pain or pushes you past your comfort level, it is time to scale back. Also, if pain starts to dictate how you perform the exercise or if it causes you to modify the activity to compensate for the pain, you are definitely doing too much ! ” 

 Signs of overtraining include : 

     Fatigue 
     Depression 
     Sleep disturbances 
     An increase in sickness 
     Unresolved muscle soreness 

 If you ’re suffering from any of these symptoms, it is time to speak with your doctor about setting a healthy workout schedule and nutrition plan. 
 Take a Break 

 If you ’re experiencing pain, the best thing to do is to rest and give your muscles or tendon the time they need to recover.   suggests using ice for acute swelling or injury, and you can apply heat to the affected area for up to 72 hours following an injury. 

 She also suggests light stretching and range of motion exercises, as well as foam rolling, yoga and massage to help stimulate the muscle and increase blood flow. If needed, you can also use topicals, anti - inflammatories or a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) unit to treat mild soreness or pain. 

 If the pain does not resolve after two weeks of rest, ice and activity modification,   recommends reaching out to your doctor. If you ’re experiencing acute pain, especially accompanied by swelling, it is better to reach out sooner rather than later. 
 Prevention 

 The best way to prevent injury and pain is to ease into your workout. Performing dynamic stretches versus static stretching has been shown to reduce muscle tightness better. Dynamic stretching is movement - based instead of holding a pose in traditional stretching. 

 For instance, instead of holding a traditional lunge, try a walking lunge with a twist. Get into a traditional lunge then twist your torso toward the front thigh. Stand back up and walk out into a lunge on the other side and repeat, twisting your torso toward that leg. 

 Traditional stretching and foam rolling can be added at the end of a workout when your muscles are already warm. 

 If at any point you experience pain, back down. It is better to stop or modify an exercise than to further any injury. 

 “ When starting a new exercise routine, take it slow, ”   says. “ Do not expect change overnight. Small steps in the right direction will get you to your goals safely and hopefully injury - free ! ” 











 Ditch the HIIT and ease back into an exercise routine with these low - impact workout ideas. 

 As someone who spends most of their time working with fitness equipment and doing fitness challenges for YouTube videos, I have suffered my fair share of injuries and have had to learn a thing or two about modifying exercises so that I can get back into a routine after getting hurt. 

 I have a hunch that if you ’re hitting the gym day - in - and - day - out, you may one day be in a situation where you need to modify your workouts to get back in the saddle too. 

 Getting back into exercise after any time off, whether it is due to an injury or not, should be a thoughtful and intentional process. The best low - impact exercises, like swimming, yoga and light resistance training are a great place to start. 

 And keep in mind, these are not your grandma is exercises. Well, they might be, but what I mean is, just because they do not involve jumping or slamming weights does not mean they have no effect. 

  They pointed out that engaging in these activities can help you gradually ( and smartly ! ) rebuild your strength so you can get back to doing what you love. 
 What Is Low - Impact Exercise? 

 Low - impact exercise training includes any kind of exercise that puts minimal stress on the joints. 

 The goal with low - impact workouts is to keep the body moving well without putting it through unwanted or unnecessary strain. 

 “ Low impact exercise is a great way to take care of your body, especially after an injury, because we rarely ever want to stop moving completely, ” she says. “ The goal is to keep moving without exacerbating pain or tissue damage. ” 

 Walking, swimming, bike riding, yoga, stretching and light strength training are great examples of activities you can do without overworking your body. Conversely, you will be ditching movements such as jumping, running, burpees, and maxing out your deadlift. 

 Who Is Low - Impact Exercise Good For? 

 Anyone can benefit from low - impact training, but it is particularly helpful for those who are rehabilitating an injury, are just returning to exercise, or are prone to joint or back pain. performing low - impact exercise is critical during the early recovery period after an injury. 

 “ Engaging in gentle exercise keeps your body as strong as possible while avoiding pain or reinjury, ” she says. “ It is important to keep your body moving while you recover, so you can ease back into fitness, instead of becoming deconditioned and then trying to jump back into an intense workout routine. ” 

 doctor Long, a licensed physical therapist adds, “ One of the biggest mistakes I see athletes make when they are injured is going into full rest mode. When we elevate our heart rate, our body releases chemicals that have pain relieving effects and pumping our heart rate up helps remove inflammation around damaged tissues. So even when tissues are significantly hurt, finding ways to exercise is a critical component to rehab. ” 

 In addition to those who are recovering from an injury, people who tend to overdo high - intensity exercise can seriously benefit from a few low - impact workout days each week. High - volume workouts have their place, but too much of a good thing can be a bad thing : Studies have shown that too much high - intensity exercise can lead to muscle damage, inflammation, delayed onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ), and fatigue. 

 Intentionally sprinkling in low - impact and low - intensity workouts each week helps prevent overtraining, which has negative physical and psychological effects. If you continue to train without giving your body ample time to recover, you may compromise strength and performance, leaving yourself at an increased risk of hurting yourself — and then you will be doing low - impact exercise because you have to, not because you chose to. 

 How to Add Low - Impact Exercise to Your Workout Routine 

 Depending on your specific scenario, you can choose to follow a program that is exclusively low - impact, or you can work some gentle exercise into your weekly routine as a complement to high - intensity training. 

 It is vital to have a well balanced program that also includes cardiovascular training, mobility exercises, and strengthening of smaller muscles that support good posture and exercise technique. 

 To achieve a balanced routine like that, we recommend using a variety of equipment, including resistance bands, light dumbbells and kettlebells, and a yoga mat for floor - based exercises. You will also want to invest in some good walking shoes and, if you have access to a swimming pool, a swimsuit you can wear for water exercises. 


 How you structure your weekly workouts is up to you and your team of fitness or medical professionals. Generally, getting at least 30 minutes of low - impact exercise each day is recommended, whether that looks like a 30 - minute walk or 20 minutes of strength training followed by 10 minutes of stretching. You may want to experiment with different workout schedules to find the combination that works best for you. 

 A good rehab program designed by your physical therapist may include gradually adding in low impact cardio in addition to rehab exercises to help regain strength and endurance. Mixing low - impact exercises into your regular exercise routine can increase overall muscle recovery and help rejuvenate your body between sessions so you can perform your best. 

 One of the most important points we can make : Take it slow. 

 “ If you have been inactive for a while due to an injury, you may be pretty deconditioned, and find that your muscles fatigue faster during a workout." “ If you try to push it too hard at the gym without building back muscle mass and strength, you put yourself at risk of reinjuring yourself. Or you may suffer from extreme muscle soreness, making the days after your workout pretty unpleasant. ” 


 Low - impact exercise is a great way to get all the benefits of physical activity without increasing your risk of a setback. 

 Best Low - Impact Exercises for Rehabbing an Injury 

 When recovering from injury, there are many low impact exercises that can help you regain your strength and mobility, decreasing recovery time. Most low impact exercise can be done at home with the right cardio machines and strength training equipment. 
 Best Low - Impact Cardio Workouts 

 Swimming 

 Swimming is the perfect low impact exercise as it takes gravity out of the equation, putting less stress on your joints. Experts often recommend swimming laps for those recovering from an injury or joint replacement or for those with inflammation or arthritis, as exercising in the water helps prevent joint pain. ( It can also be a fun change compared to typical cardio workouts on land — I will not judge if you join your local water aerobics class. ) 

 Biking 

 Biking, whether it be on an exercise bike or outdoor training, is low impact as the bike offers support and stability, taking pressure off the joints of the hips, knees and ankles. Biking is primarily a cardiovascular exercise — it will definitely get your heart rate up — but it can also help you build muscle, increase overall mobility and increase joint range of motion, which is important for those recovering from an injury. 

 If you need extra support for your joints, doctor suggests trying a recumbent stationary bike until your joints are healthy and strong enough to support you on a regular bike. 

 Rowing 

 If you really want to get your heart pumping sans impact, try rowing for low - impact cardio exercise. Unless you live close to a lake, stationary rowing machines are the go to piece of equipment when it comes to a rowing workout. Rowing works all muscles of the body, is easy on the joints, and can be done at varying intensities. 

 Like biking, it can increase cardiovascular fitness and mobility and is a great way to move the body gently but effectively. Rowing also amps up the calorie burn and can help with weight loss. 

 Elliptical 

 Ellipticals are designed to provide a low impact, full - body workout, without putting extra strain on the joints and ligaments. Ellipticals provide good cardio workouts for beginners, older adults, those recovering from injury, or for those who are unable to run due to physical limitations. 

 Ellipticals provide a similar workout to cycling, except you remain in a standing position, which helps activate your core and upper body. They not only help increase endurance after an injury but can be a good way to flush out the muscles if you are feeling sore after a workout. 
 Best Low - Impact Strength Training Exercises 

 Resistance Band Training 

 Tube resistance bands offer varying levels of tension and can be used for many different body parts. Resistance band exercises are a great low intensity option as it is easier to target small muscles such as those in the shoulders or hips and can be used for rehab exercises as well as accessory work. This will help you regain strength in areas that are weak post - injury and prepare you for harder workouts in the future. 

 Yoga 

 We have all heard that we should do yoga for the mindfulness aspect, but if you are used to heavy strength training this can be a drastic change of pace with awesome benefits for your health and wellness. 

 Yoga moves your body through a series of postures and isometric positions and is a great way to stretch out tight muscles, improve posture and focus on breathing so you can perform better in all areas of life. ( And do not get it twisted : Yoga is hard. I always underestimate the challenge that is a yoga flow. ) 

 Light Dumbbell Exercises You do not always have to lift heavy when doing dumbbell exercises. By moving slowly and using a lighter weight than you normally would, dumbbell work can be a great low - intensity exercise to do after an injury. Light dumbbells can be used to rehab the muscles of the shoulders, back, arms, legs, and glutes. 

 These exercises are a great opportunity to focus on form as you recover from injury so you can continue to move correctly as you start to lift heavier weights. Squats, lunges, and dumbbell deadlifts are great low - impact exercises for the lower body ; dumbbell bench press, overhead press, and bicep curls are good choices for your upper body. 

 Bodyweight Strength Training 

 Believe it or not, you do not need dumbbells or any other equipment for an effective resistance training workout. Bodyweight strength training is one of the best low - impact activities — if you choose the right exercises. 

 Avoid jumping jacks and burpees and stick to things like squats and modified push - ups to reap the benefits of low - impact exercise. Also, practicing and perfecting proper form with just your body weight helps to reduce your risk of injury when you do decide to add external weight. 

 Dynamic Stretches 

 Dynamic stretches are a fun way to warm up, but you can also do them in isolation to help stretch the muscles and increase range of motion. Unlike static stretches ( where you stay in one position ) you are constantly moving through various movements to loosen up the muscles and ligaments. They can be used for injury prevention but are also helpful for post - injury rehab. No matter your fitness level, stretching is a key part of a well - rounded workout routine. 

 Core Strengthening Exercises 

 If you are lacking core strength due to inactivity, it is key to rebuild your core strength before jumping into a high intensity strength program, doctor says. “ Core strengthening is especially important after a back injury and will help prevent future injuries when done properly. ” Some examples of low - impact core exercises include : bird dogs, dead bugs, Russian twists, and lying flutter kicks. 

 Coop is Take 

 Low - impact exercises are a great way to stimulate your muscles when recovering from an injury or a really intense strength training session. Not only do they keep you active without adding unnecessary stress to your body, but a low - impact workout is a great opportunity to focus on areas of your body that may not be getting enough attention in your normal workout routine. 

 This not only helps boost performance but adds some variety to your week to keep things interesting, preventing burnout. Although high intensity exercise is often seen as more fun, do not discredit the benefits of low intensity exercise, especially if you ’re coming off an injury or have taken some time away from the gym. 
 Bottom Line 

 If you are active, it is not uncommon to sustain an injury at some point in your life. This should not deter you from ever working out again, but it may change how your workouts look for a while. Just because you are hurting does not mean that you should not exercise, but you may have to incorporate more low - intensity exercises for a while until you can build back your strength and endurance. Even if you are not injured, ditching your usual high - impact workouts for some gentler aerobic exercise a few times per week has amazing health benefits. 












 here are 10 modifications that you can use to prevent further injury while maintaining strength in other areas. You might also want to refresh your memory with more on the subject here : Dealing with Setbacks — How to Stay Fit While Injured or Sick. 

 1. Limit total workout volume. 
 Unless you ’re an exercise science guru, exercise volume may be a new concept. We will go over the basics and then show you how to apply it to your workout routine. Exercise calculations, like volume, can be used as a method to measure workout intensity. Generally, volume is calculated using this equation : 

 Workout Volume = ( the amount of weight that you 're lifting ) x ( number of sets ) x ( repetitions ) 

 For example, if you lift 20 lbs ( 9 kg ) on the overhead shoulder press for 3 sets of 10 repetitions, then your workout volume would be ( 20 lbs ) x ( 3 sets ) x ( 10 reps ) = 600 lbs ( 272 kg ) for that particular exercise. 

 When you ’re injured, your workout volume should always be less than your pre - injury volume. To calculate this, modify one ( or all ) of the variables in the above equation. Some examples of ways in which you can change your training volume include : 

     Decrease the number of sets you perform 
     Limit the number of repetitions you do 
     Lower the amount of weight you lift 

 The good news is that you can work out and maintain fitness levels even if you need to temporarily lower your workout volume. By doing so, you ’re significantly decreasing your risk for greater injury and reduce the possibility of weakness from inactivity. 

 2. Modify your positioning or lifting technique. 
 Depending on the type of injury you sustained, you may need to modify your body position or lifting technique. For example, deep squats should be avoided for people with hip, knee, ankle, or low back injuries. Instead, take a wide stance and practice mini - squats or wall slides. People who are recovering from shoulder and neck injuries should avoid overhead motions and prioritize shoulder stabilization exercises or upper back strengthening. 

 3. Give yourself more time to recover between sets. 
 Consider taking more time to rest between reps, sets, and workout days. Rest periods are an underutilized factor when it comes to modifying an exercise routine, especially while recovering from an injury. Many people use shorter rest periods to increase the intensity of the workout ; however, increasing the length of the rest periods can have the opposite effect ( i.e., allowing for lower intensity ). 

 4. Focus on unilateral movements to strengthen the weakened areas. 
 Unilateral movements is a common term used to describe motions that involve one side of the body. Incorporating them into a workout is an effective way to address weakness and instability in the body. Oftentimes, unilateral movements target important accessory muscles that work to stabilize your body when doing larger movements. some examples of unilateral movements include : 


     Lunges 
     Step ups 
     Lying leg lifts 
     Clamshells 
     Single leg bridges 
     Single leg RDLs ( Romanian dead lifts ) 
     Single arm shoulder press 
     Bent over dumbbell row 
     Dumbbell chest press 
     Dumbbell bicep curl 

 5. Consider doing different forms of exercise while you recover. 
 Look on the bright side : sometimes the " best " part of an injury is discovering a new activity that you otherwise would have never attempted. And one of the most effective ways to maintain fitness levels when you ’re injured is through something called cross training. 

 Cross training involves participating in similar types of exercise to develop a specific component of fitness. You may have heard this term referenced by marathon runners or triathlon participants, since it is a widely - used method to improve cardiovascular health and endurance. While these athletes use cross training as a way to rest their bodies from repetitive motions, you can use it as a way to stay physically active during recovery. 

 For example, those who are unable to run or jog may prefer to swim or row, since the latter is less jarring to the joints in the lower body. Similarly, people who suffer from wrist and hand injuries may not be able to tolerate cycling and, instead, should jog or go for a brisk walk. 

 6. Work through a pain - free range of motion. 
 This goes without saying, but let is take a second to discuss why this is important. Pain with movement is a sign that something is not right. Along with that, any strong, sharp, or persistent pain that develops during exercise should be considered as a red flag and cause for concern. 


 If you notice pain or discomfort with movement, especially as you ’re recovering from an injury, either stop what you ’re doing or modify your movement. Suggestions on how to modify the movement include changing the activity, decreasing your range of motion, or limiting your reps / sets. 

 7. Cautiously reintroduce new exercises. 
 Our bodies tend to gravitate towards certain patterns of movement. Over time, the body becomes adept at those particular movement patterns, which increases our vulnerability to injury when doing something new. Therefore, when introducing new exercises after an injury, you should move cautiously and with purpose. 

 The concept of movement patterns is not new, and physical therapists frequently use this principle to help people recover from injury. You can also take advantage of this by strengthening weakened areas of the body using multiple forms of the same exercise. One example of this would be to perform side and reverse lunges in addition to forward lunges. 

 8. Substituting pain - free exercises for painful ones is okay. 
 Like cross training, substituting pain - free exercises for painful ones is another way to maintain your fitness levels as you recover from an injury. Unable to lie flat for bench press? Strengthen the chest muscles by doing an incline press or weighted push - ups instead. Sore wrists during planks? Drop down to your elbows or make a fist. 

 9. Do not be afraid to take some time off. 
 Admittedly, there are times when the modifications on this list are not enough. If that is the case, then it is best to take some time off from exercising or see a specialist. In the meantime, focus on your body is strengths and exercises that you can perform without pain or limitation. Yoga, walking, and gentle pool exercises are often great alternatives to strength or HIIT workouts. 

 10. Ease back into exercise after recovery. 

 Once you are ready to start exercising again, it is best to ease back into it. Avoid the temptation to load the same amount of weight that you used before the injury, and fight the urge to do your usual reps / sets scheme. Gradually reintroducing movement and strengthening exercises is the best way to prevent reinjury. Use low reps and sets so you can focus on form, control, and stability. As always, prioritize core stabilization exercises to ensure that your foundation remains strong and healthy. 

 Final thoughts. Recovering from an injury can be frustrating, but it does not have to signal the end of your workout days. Find ways to exercise in a pain - free manner that does not place you at further risk for harm. Use some, or all, of the modifications listed above, and share your best tips for returning from an injury with us below in the comment section.

 Add Equipment 

 This resource is designed to make fitness as accessible as possible, make it easy to start and continue with training on a daily basis indefinitely and make it part of your lifestyle – without spending any money and without any special equipment. 

 All workouts here are almost entirely based on bodyweight exercises and whatever else you can find and make into a piece of equipment ( boxes, baskets, chairs etc. ). You can add equipment to the routines if you have it on hand, though, to make our routines more challenging. 

 You can use equipment, but you do not have to. It is a personal thing, and once you are used to regular training you will be able to tell whether you need to add something extra or not. If you are a beginner, we strongly suggest that you do not buy anything until you have done at least two months ’ worth of training to know you will use the extra equipment and it will not just gather dust in the corner. Do not waste any money unless you are absolutely sure you need something and you will use it. 

 Add dumbbells to : squats, lunges, side lunges, punches, cross chops, arm raises, sitting twists and get - ups. 

 Dumbbells 

 Dumbbells hack : instead of dumbbells you can use two plastic bottles and fill them with water or sand. 

 Dumbbells are perhaps the one of few pieces of equipment that are worth buying - as long as you make sure you use them regularly. Place them in front of the TV, you can do 10 - 20 basic biceps curls while you are watching your favourite show. Never, ever put them away – otherwise you will create an out - of - sight, out - of - mind situation. Even if you have to trip over them every time you go to the kitchen, it will still be a constant reminder that they are there, if you need them and you need them right now.  

 Modify Chops : 

 Chops 

 Add sandbag to : squats, lunges and push - ups 

 Sandbag 

 Any old gym bag can be turned into a sand bag and any laundry basket filled with books into a piece of lifting equipment – use your imagination. 

 Replace bicep extensions with dumbbell curls or resistant band curls : 

 Working biceps with bodyweight training 

 Add ankle and wrist weights for additional difficulty 

 Ankle weights are best for : flutter kicks, side leg raises, slow climbers, leg raises, kicks 
 Wrist weights are best for : punching, raised arm circles, punches and overhead punches 












 ALTERNATIVES TO RUNNING WHILE INJURED 

 Injuries afflict most of us at some point. When addressed early, many injuries can be resolved with rest and training plan adjustments. But more serious injuries may require months away from running. 

 How can you best stay fit during all that time off? 

 No athlete wants to be sidelined by an injury. Running may be what you love best, but in order to help yourself come back stronger time out is essential. It is extremely important to allow time to heal and focus on a comprehensive rehabilitation program. If we fail to do his we find ourselves in a vicious circle of early return to activity and re injury. This makes the process a lot longer and ultimately far more distressing. It is vital to honor the body and remember that staying active fit and healthy is something we prioritise for life. With that important perspective shift we can accept that recovery breaks are temporary, necessary and vital. 

 So while the process of rehabilitation takes place we can focus on what we CAN do.   Both endurance - oriented cross - training and strength work can be used to maintain your aerobic fitness and strengthen the supportive structures that help you move injury - free. 

 Certain types of cross - training such as pool running, cycling and the elliptical are the most effective for aerobic exercise and can support aerobic conditioning for return running.     types of cross - training, such as strength training, swimming and Pilates, are more complementary to running. Always follow your physiotherapists guidelines as to what type of cross - training is suitable to your injury and recovery process. 
 POOL RUNNING 

 If you ’re injured and unable to perform any weight - bearing exercise, aqua jogging should be your go - to method for maintaining fitness. Of all types of cross - training, pool running is the most running specific. This means it is most similar to actual running in respect to your movement and biomechanics. 

 You can replicate just about any type of running workout in the pool, from tempos to intervals to long runs. So what is the down side of pool running? It is not terribly exciting, especially if you ’re trying to push through a 2 - hour long run. But if you can hang in there with a little monotony, you will see the benefits when you ’re able to hit the road again. 
 CYCLING 

 Cycling is another type of cross - training that is particularly runner specific. Because it is a non - weight bearing exercise, injured runners can often cycle pain - free. Like pool running, it provides a perfect opportunity to replicate workouts such as tempos and intervals. 

 Cycling helps strengthen the quads, outer hips and glutes, which all tend to be weaker in runners. When replacing a running session with a cycling workout, 10–15 minutes on the bike is roughly the equivalent of running one mile. Try to keep your cadence at about 90 + RPMs ( rotations per minute ), as this helps mimic a running stride. 
 ELLIPTICAL 

 A third cross - training option that is also runner - specific and low - impact is the elliptical. Working out on an elliptical closely mimics your running movement with little - to - no impact on your joints. Make sure to use enough resistance to get your heart rate elevated for an aerobic workout. 

 Like pool running, ellipticals can also be a little monotonous. An alternative, if available, is the assault bike. A number of elite runners have used these as a supplement to their training. They have all the benefits of an elliptical machine while allowing you break the monotony. 
   TRAINING 

 Strength training is a broad term that encompasses everything from core exercises to bodyweight workouts to lifting weights at the gym. Whether you are injured or not, strength training should be a part of every runner is routine. But if you ca not run, now is an excellent time to get stronger and more resilient 

 Glutes and hips are a common weak area for runners, which can lead to a multitude of injuries. Strengthening these areas is essential to healthy running. If you are new to strength training, bodyweight routines and machine weight machines are a perfect way to get started. Add repetitions as you improve, and gradually progress to using heavier weights under the guidance of our physiotherapists.  
 SWIMMING 

 Swimming is an outstanding full - body workout with no impact. While it may be challenging to get a true aerobic workout from swimming unless you ’re already a proficient swimmer, it can add variety to the types of training described above. 

 If you have a new or nagging injury, you can substitute in a 30–45 minute swim once a week to help maintain aerobic fitness.  

 PILATES 


 Pilates can be a great complement to endurance training and will help work some mobility back into tight, inflexible muscles and joints. 
 Pilates has a strong emphasis on core strength and stability which improves pelvic stability during running. With its emphasis on focused breath and movement no matter the pace, Pilates can also develop your body awareness. 

 Although getting injured may temporarily take you away from the sport you love, know that what with a commitment to rehabilitation you will improve fitness and strength meaning you will come back stronger than ever. 













 If you ’re looking for an exercise program to help you effectively build mass, you may be looking for something to do with hypertrophy training. Similar to classic strength training, the goals of hypertrophy are different. One focuses on building strength and the other on building muscle mass. 

 Hypertrophy is defined as " the enlargement of skeletal muscle fibers in response to being recruited to develop increased levels of tension, as seen in resistance training. [ It ] is characterized by an increase in the cross - sectional area of individual muscle fibers resulting from an increase in myofibril proteins ( myofilaments ). ” 

 Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands ( SAID ) Principle states that adaptations are specific to the imposed stimulus.  If the demand is not placed on the muscle over time the muscle will begin to atrophy. 
 What is Hypertrophy? 

 Research indicates that performing approximately 15 - 20 sets of challenging hypertrophy exercises per week is the optimum stimulus to enhance muscle size. Since maximal muscle response is achieved through 5 - 6 sets of a specific exercise, it is best to spread the workload throughout the week. 

 This means that training beyond the maximal growth stimulus you will disrupt the stimulus - recovery - adaptation curve by delaying the recovery phase, which is counterproductive to muscle growth.  

 First, consider a variety of different exercises. Since muscle damage is a function of loading and tension, high tension and high damage exercises will require more time for recovery. These exercises will also stimulate stronger muscle adaptations that will effectively enable it to withstand more tension in subsequent training. 

 For example, doing five sets of heavy bench press will cause far more muscle breakdown than 5 sets of pushups. High - tension and high - damage exercises, therefore, require more recovery time but cause greater adaptation. Exercises featuring an increased range of motion, more time under tension, a greater load, and a longer eccentric portion are typically the preferred stimulus to maximize muscle hypertrophy. 

 Muscle Hypertrophy is also a function of Maximal Voluntary Isometric Contraction and loading / unloading. In other words, the more muscle fiber you can activate through a specific exercise and loading, the greater the demand ( stimulus ) and therefore the greater the hypertrophy response. 
 Mechanisms for Hypertrophy & Muscular Development 
 1 ) Exercise - Induced Muscle Damage 

 During eccentric activity, the contractile elements ( actin and myosin ) in working muscles exert a resistance action that produces small tears in both the contractile elements and surface membrane ( sarcolemma ) of the associated muscle fibers. The subsequent muscle repair ( recovery ) strengthens the tissue to protect against further damage ( adaptation ). 
 2 ) Metabolic Stress 

 Metabolic stress results from the buildup of various metabolites ( e.g., lactic acid, inorganic phosphate, etc. ), primarily because of training in the fast glycolytic energy system where carbohydrates are used anaerobically to fuel performance. 
 3 ) Mechanical Tension ( force ) 

 Refers to the amount of force / tension within the muscle fibers in response to a static or dynamic stimulus. The reaction increases protein synthesis and muscle size. The goal is to activate as many muscle fibers as possible to maximize the response. 


 4 ) Fascia Stretch Training 

 Pumping specific muscle groups full of oxygenated blood in a relatively short period of time, forcing the fascia tissue to stretch and expand like a balloon. This packs nutrient and oxygen rich blood into and around the muscle cells to promote repair and growth. 

 Speaking of stretching, you can learn more about its relationship with hypertrophy below. 

 How to Train for Hypertrophy – Rep Ranges and Sets 

 Hypertrophy / Muscular Development training is typically moderate - heavy loading ( 75 - 85 % 1RM),6 - 12 reps, 2 - 0 - 2, 0 - 60 or 0 - 30 rests, 3 - 6 sets ( up to 7 ), 2 - 4 Strength exercises per body part.

 opt model pyramid Sets – The volume of sets can be modified over time as your training progress. Starting out, try shooting for 3 sets of a few different exercises for each major muscle group ( or complex movements ). For intermediate lifters, increase your set volume to 4 - 6 sets. For advanced lifters or athletes, it is common to see as many as 6 - 7 working sets per exercise. 

 Reps – Similar to sets, reps are an opportunity to manipulate training volume. For strength hypertrophy, 6 - 12 reps with moderately heavy loading 75 - 85 % 1RM are most effective. 

 For the best all - around workout, I recommend pyramiding up in weight over the course of your working sets. This will maximize hypertrophy and still work the high and low end of the spectrum. 

 Force – Loading ( % 1RM ) 

 Time Under Tension ( TUT ) – Length of time the muscle stimulus creates tension 

 Cadence – This is the timing of your concentric and eccentric motions during a lift. This can vary depending on the specific goal. For example, stability and strength - endurance type of exercises may use a 4/2/1 ( seconds ) tempo ( eccentric / isometric stabilization / concentric ) whereas the typical cadence for hypertrophy training is 2/0/2. 

 Rest Intervals – Another often overlooked acute variable is rest intervals. This refers to the rest between sets. For most training, 0 - 60 seconds is sufficient to replenish 85 to 90 % of ATP and PC and keep your muscles pumped up. For strength endurance and stabilization, 0 - 90 seconds is recommended. If you are training for maximal strength / powerlifting, be sure to rest 3 - 5 mins between sets to ensure your system is fully recovered. 
 Vertical vs Horizontal Loading : 

 There are several different ways to execute your hypertrophy training. Horizontal loading is the most common. In horizontal loading, each exercise or muscle group is completely trained before moving on to the next exercise. Vertical loading is often seen in circuit training when each circuit is comprised of a sequence of back - to - back exercises. ( i.e., chest press > squats > rows, repeat ). Both have benefits and serve different purposes. 

 For most hypertrophy training and those chasing the pump, horizontal loading is usually the best to keep the specific muscle(s ) flooded with oxygenated blood and nutrients and maximize tension. 
 Progressive Overloading : 

 Remember, your body is always in a state of adaptation. You want to improve your cardiovascular performance and VO2 threshold, you will want to stress and challenge that area of the nervous system. If you want to improve your maximal strength ( i.e., Powerlifting ), you will need to train low reps, heavy loads to create that specific adaptation. The key is to shift training phases every 3 - 4 weeks ( or as needed ) to create muscle confusion and force your body to continuously adapt to the stress placed upon it. 

 A decrease in loading ( unloading ) over an extended period can cause muscle atrophy - a loss in skeletal muscle mass and strength. With consistent training the body will adapt to the progressions and meet the demands of the stress placed upon it. 

 * Note that mechanisms such as progressive overloading allow you to remain in a specific phase ( i.e., Hypertrophy / Muscular Development for bodybuilding ) for longer periods without risking a plateau. 










 There are so many ways to customize dumbbell workouts, too. Go light to ramp up the intensity of a HIIT circuit. Go heavy to maximize hypertrophy, working through supersets or time under tension. Free weights can take the place of barbells and kettlebells and help you reach your goals, be it weight loss, mass, endurance, or just a more athletic - looking body. 

 Not sure how many reps to go with for your dumbbell exercises? Use our rep range guide. We highlight the benefits of using high reps ( 15 + ), low reps ( 5 or less ), and moderate reps ( 8 - 12 ) depending on your goals.

 28 Best Dumbbell Exercises For Chest, Arms, Shoulders, Back & Legs 

 Here, PT Ollie Frost and Men is Health fitness director     recommend the best dumbbell exercises to add to your arsenal. You will discover why each exercise is worth its salt, find out which specific muscles the move targets, and learn how to execute it with faultless form : 

 Scroll on for our pick of the best dumbbell exercises for building muscle – all 28 of them. There is no time like the present, so get to work. 
 bicep curls 
 1. Bicep Curl 

 Muscles worked : Biceps, deltoids, brachialis and brachioradialis. 

 How : Holding a dumbbell in each hand and with your arms hanging by your sides, curl the weights up to shoulder level while contracting your biceps. 

 Why : This list would not be complete without curls, which are a perfect beginner exercise. The trick is not to go heavy ; it is all about lengthening and shortening the muscle, so grab a weight you 're comfortable with and away you go.

 2. Goblet Squat Muscles worked : Quads, calves, glutes, abs, arms and grip strength. 

 How : Stand with feet set wider than shoulder - width and hold a dumbbell with both hands in front of your chest. Sit back into a squat, then drive back up and repeat. 


 Why : Are you a nervous newbie or a long - time hard gainer? It does not matter with this move. ' Goblet squats are perfect for any level, ' says Frost. ' They specifically target glute activation whilst improving both hip and thoracic mobility. ' 
 Arnold press 
 3. Arnold Press 

 Muscles worked : Deltoids, triceps, traps. 

 How : Sit on a bench with dumbbells held in front of you, palms facing your shoulders as though you have just finished a bicep curl. Push the dumbbells up over your head while rotating your arms until your palms face away from you. Straighten your arms, pause, then reverse the movement. 

 Why : If the fact that it was invented by Schwarzenegger himself was not already reason enough, this potent upper - body move is unique in that it hits all three sections of your deltoid – the round - looking muscle that caps your shoulders – adding thickness and width, and reinforcing the joint.

 4. Dumbbell Clean 

 Muscles worked : Glutes, calves, quads, biceps. 

 How : Flip your wrists so they face forwards and bring the weights to your shoulders, slightly jumping as you do. Slowly straighten your legs to stand. Then lower the weights down to your thigh before moving into squat position and repeating. 

 Why : If you want to look like an Olympian, you have got to train like one. ' Incorporating these powerlifter lifts into your training will not only build lean muscle tissue but also build explosive power, ' says Frost. This move also rushes blood to your glutes, hamstrings, shoulders and arms to maximise your muscle - growing power.

 5. Renegade Row 

 Muscles worked : Traps, lats, rhomboids, delts, abs, obliques, biceps, triceps, forearms. 

 How : Get into a press - up position with your hands on the handles of two dumbbells. Keeping your core tensed, row the right dumbbell up to your abs then return to the start position. Repeat with the left dumbbell to complete one rep. 

 Why : Build a strong back, ignite your abs, and develop anti - rotational core strength in one fell swoop. While it is tempting to focus on the ‘ row ’ aspect of the movement, the secret to getting the most out of this move is to double down on your plank positioning.

 6. Farmers ’ Walk 

 Muscles worked : Upper back, shoulders, triceps and biceps, forearms, abs, glutes, hamstrings, quads, adductors, abductors and calf muscles. 

 How : Walk forward taking short, quick steps. Go for the given distance, as fast as possible. 

 Why : For once, there is no sophisticated form rules to worry about ( except for ‘ brace your core ’. Always brace your core ). And you will supercharge your grip strength, which is a serious plus. Additionally, this move fortifies your rotator cuffs, protecting your shoulders from injury during bigger lifts. 
   
 7.  

 Muscle worked : Biceps, brachialis and brachioradialis. 

 How : With a pair of dumbbells by your sides and with your palms facing forwards, curl the weights up to your shoulders. Once you reach the top of the movement pause, and then turn your hands so your palms are facing downwards as you slowly return then dumbbells back to the starting position using this overhand grip. When the dumbbells reach your thighs again, turn your hands so your palms are back in the starting position facing forward. 

 Why : As well as training your biceps, this move will also fire up your forearms. 
 chest exercises 
 8. Flat Dumbbell Fly   Muscles worked : Delts, pecs, rhomboids, serratus anterior, rotator cuffs, biceps. 

 How : Lie down on a flat bench holding two dumbbells at your shoulders with your palms facing inwards. Press the dumbbells up until your arms are almost fully extended. This is your starting position. From here, with a slight bend in your arms, arc the weights down to your sides until you feel a stretch across your chest. Squeeze your pecs to return the weights to the start position by reversing the movement. 

 Why : Believe it or not, this move is better than the bench press for stimulating the chest muscle fibres that spark growth – and you do not need anywhere near as heavy weights to do it. Just take care not to lock your arms out during the extension, or you will transfer the load away from your pecs and onto your elbow joints.

 9. Bent - Over Row 

 Muscles worked : Lats, shoulders, forearms, biceps, spinal erectors, hamstrings, glutes. 

 How : Keep your core tight and your back straight as you row the weights up to your chest. Lower and repeat. 

 Why : ' Rows will target several muscles in your upper body including the traps, rhomboids, lats and biceps perfect for getting you that ‘ V ’ shape, ' says Frost. And not only that, it will hone in on your deltoids to create some T - shirt - filling boulder shoulders, too. 
 devils press 
 10. Devil is Press 

 Muscles worked : Quads, glutes, calves, core, chest, shoulders and arms. 

 How : Holding both dumbbells, drop down into a press - up position and perform a burpee. As you begin to stand back up, use the momentum to swing the weights between your legs, then directly overhead. Lower under control, back to the ground and repeat. 

 Why : If you feel like burpees are getting too easy, try the devil is press. Aside from the potent cardio hit, it builds power and strength with the addition of the dumbbells by using nearly every muscle in your body. They will make traditional burpees feel a breeze. 
 home back workouts, dumbbells 
 11. Two - Arm Dumbbell Stiff Legged Deadlift 

 Muscles worked : Hamstrings, erectors, lats, glutes. 

 How : Lower the dumbbells to the top of your feet, as far as you can go by extending through your waist, then slowly return to the starting position. 

 Why : It shreds your legs into powerful pins by targeting your fast - twitch lower - body muscles. Plus, stiff legged deadlifts ensure your entire posterior chain is functioning effectively and prevents hip and lower back injuries, says Frost. It is one of the best free weight exercises to build up your lower body – injury free. 
 tricep kickback 
 12. Dumbbell Kickbacks 

 Muscles worked : Triceps. 

 How : Hinge at the hips by sending your hips behind your heels with a flat back. Start with your arms bent, bringing the dumbbells next to your thighs so your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Straighten your arms behind you using your forearms. Return slowly to the start position and repeat. 

 Why : Hands up if you ’re guilty of neglecting your triceps? Yeah, we thought as much. They might not be mirror muscles, but strong tris are essential for effective upper - body training, and your chest and shoulders in particular stand to benefit. This move targets the lateral head – the most visible of the three heads on your tricep – to build sleeve - filling muscle.

 13. One Arm Swing 

 Muscles worked : Glutes and hamstrings, abs, quads, shoulders. 

 How : Sink into a squat and swing the dumbbell through your legs before immediately driving yourself forward, bringing the weight up towards your head as you straighten your legs. Repeat this movement, then swap sides. 

 Why : With proper form, this swing will not only recruit muscles within your posterior chain but it will also build your grip strength, co - ordination, lower back muscles, quadriceps and shoulders. In other words, it will give you the momentum your body transformation workout needs. Most traditional kettlebell moves can be replicated.

 14. Dumbbell Bench Press 

 Muscles worked : Pecs, shoulders, triceps, forearms, lats, traps, rhomboids. 

 How : Lie on a flat bench holding two dumbbells over your chest with an overhand grip. Push up until your arms are straight, then lower under control. 


 Why : If you ’re looking to build quality pecs appeal then always opt for a dumbbell press over barbell. Why? A weight in each hands allows for a greater stretch at the bottom of the lift, building a bigger chest. And if you want to take this move further? ' Squeeze your pecs together at the top of the lift to recruit as many muscle fibres as possible, ' says Frost. 
 strict dumbbell shoulder press 
 15. Dumbbell Shoulder Press 

 Muscles worked : Delts, traps, triceps, pecs, core. 

 How : Position your feet shoulder - width apart and stand holding two dumbbells at shoulder height with an overhand grip. Press the weights up above your head until your arms are fully extended. Return slowly to the start position. 

 Why : You want boulder shoulders, right? This compound move is essential for building strength, size and power. By performing it standing, you will recruit your abdominal muscles, which will improve your posture and stability. Be sure to brace your core throughout the full range of motion – protruding ribcages and arched backs are a no - go.

 16. Cross Body Hammer Curl 

 Muscles worked : Biceps, brachialis, forearms. 

 How : One at a time, curl each weight up towards your opposing shoulder. Return under control to the start position and repeat on the other side. 

 Why : To win the arms race, divide and conquer. Focusing on one arm at a time creates a large neural drive, which engages the nervous system to recruit more muscle fibres. 

 Dumbbell one arm upright row 
 17. Dumbbell Upright Row 

 Muscles worked : Delts, traps, rhomboids, biceps. 

 How : Hold a dumbbell in one hand in front of your body with an overhand grip. Raise your elbow up and to the side using your shoulder muscles to raise the weight up towards your chin. Lower under control back to the start position. 

 Why : As a unilateral exercise, the upright row can help you address any muscle asymmetries that have developed along your weightlifting journey. The movement also boosts your range of motion, which is integral to pretty much every upper body exercise you can think of. Remember to keep your elbows higher than your forearms.

 18. Step - ups 

 Muscles worked : Quads, hamstrings, glutes, core. 

 How : Place your right foot onto the elevated platform and push up through your heel to lift yourself up and place your left foot on the platform. Step back down with your left foot, concentrating on flexing your hip and the knee of your right leg. Repeat on the other side. 

 Why : It is a sure - fire way to maximise your gluteus maximus, the major muscle responsible for extending, rotating and adducting and abducting from the hip joint. Plus, as a single leg exercise, it will increase stabiliser strength of the smaller muscles around the joint, protecting you against injuries. 
 prone dumbbell curls 
 19. Dumbbell Spider Curl 

 Muscles worked : Biceps, triceps. 

 How : Lie on an incline bench and hold a dumbbell in each hand, letting them hang underneath your shoulders. Use your biceps to curl the dumbbells towards your shoulders. Slowly return to starting position and repeat. 

 Why : There are a few benefits. For one, with your arms hanging forward, you have a greater range of motion than your classic curl allows for. Plus, the nature of the position means your arm muscles are under constant tension throughout the full range of the move.

 20. Dumbbell Scaption 

 Muscles worked : Back, shoulders. 

 How : Arc the weights up to your sides keeping your arms straight at all times until you feel a strong stretch across your shoulders. Return slowly to the start position. 

 Why : Rotator cuff, shoulder impingement and tears are common issues from overuse exercises, but not if you use the scaption. By targeting your stabilising muscles it protects the shoulder joint and ligaments surrounding it.

 21. Bent Arm Dumbbell Pull Over Muscles worked : Lats, shoulders, triceps, pecs, serratus anterior. 

 How : Lie down on a flat bench. Hold the dumbbell in both hands above you with slightly bent arms. Keeping your arms bent, arc the weight back behind your head and then slowly return to the start position. 

 Why : This exercise trains opposing muscles in your chest and back, improving stability, range of motion and posture. A Schwarzenegger staple, it doubles down on your pecs and lats, stimulating unprecedented muscle growth. You will also need to brace your glutes and core muscles to stabilise yourself as you extend the dumbbell behind you.

 22. Reverse Dumbbell Lunge 

 Muscles worked : Calves, abs, lower back. 

 How : Stand with dumbbells at your side and palms facing your body. Lunge backwards as far as you can with your right leg, bending your front knee so it almost brushes the floor. Use the heel of your right foot to push your upper body back to the starting position. Repeat with the opposite leg. 

 Why : Do not sleep on this classic. Often the original moves are the most effective. Weighted lunges will strengthen your back, hips, and legs, while also improving your mobility and stability. Win - win. 

 one leg dumbbell deadlift 
 23. Single - Leg Romanian Deadlift 

 Muscles worked : Hamstrings, glutes, ankles and core. 

 How : Hold two dumbbells in front of your thighs, palm facing inwards. Slowly lift one leg straight behind you, bending the other slightly, and lean forward so that your arms lower the dumbbells towards the floor. Pause, then return to upright position. 

 Why : Since it requires full coordination from your ankle, knee, hip, and spine, unilateral leg training makes for a far stronger deadlift. Pro tip : do not allow the hip of the lifted leg to rotate upwards on the way down, and resist the urge to lose your form once you return to the starting position. Keep it tight.

 24. Single Dumbbell Shoulder Raise 

 Muscles worked : Delts, triceps, traps, upper chest. 

 How : Place one hand on either side of a dumbbell and let it hang between your legs. Lift the dumbbell directly above your head, then lower it back down and repeat. 

 Why : As the name suggests, the shoulder raise primarily strengthens the shoulders, but also works the upper chest muscles.

 25. Dumbbell Calf Raise 

 Muscles worked : Calves, grip strength. 

 How : Stand upright holding two dumbbells by your sides. Place the balls of your feet on an exercise step or weight plate with your heels touching the floor. With your toes pointing forwards, raise your heels off the floor and contract your calves. Slowly return to the starting position. 

 Why : A staple of leg day, calf raises will build you bigger calves, as well strengthening your ankle stability and mobility.

 26.  

 Muscles worked : Triceps, core, abs. 

 How : Lie with your back on the ground, legs straight, two dumbbells held directly over your shoulders. Tighten your abs, pressing your lower back into the ground. Raise your legs an inch off the ground. Raise your shoulder blades off the ground. Keeping your arms straight, shift your upper arms back slightly. Bending only at the elbows, lower the weights until they nearly touch your shoulders, keeping the rest of your body tight in the starting position. Press back up, straightening only at the elbows. 

 Why : ' Very often, people arch their backs slightly during skullcrushers, ' says. You ca not do that in the hollow body position, he says, because the position inherently forces you to operate with abs tight, closing your ribcage. 
  
  
 by Men is Health US 
 27. Rotational Decline Weighted Sit - up 

 Muscles worked : Core, abs. 

 How : Start by positioning yourself in the decline bench, gripping a light weight with both hands. Lower your torso down so that its parallel to the ground. Hold the weight straight out from your chest, keeping your arms as straight as possible. Rotate your torso and arms to one side as far as possible, twisting from low in your torso. Pause for 1 or 2 seconds. Rotate back to center while also squeezing your core to perform a sit - up, keeping your arms straight and bringing the weight overhead. Repeat on the opposite side. 

 Why : ' This move is one - stop shopping for your abs, ' says. ' Among the things your core does for you : it braces your torso, flexes your spine, rotates your torso, and fights rotation of your torso ( anti - rotation ). You ’re doing these four things in this one move. '

 28. Dumbbell Thruster 

 Muscles worked : Quads, glutes, hamstrings, shoulders, arms and core. 

 How : Begin with the dumbbells in the front rack position with the end of the bells resting on your shoulders. Squat down while keeping your chest open until your thighs break parallel. Push through the heels explosively back to standing, let the effort of the squat power the dumbbells into the overhead position. Bring the dumbbells back to your shoulders ready for your next rep. 

 Why : Dumbbell thrusters are great way to see a multitude of benefits from one singular move. They push your cardio while delivering a shoulder and quad pump to get the job done. It is not often that combining two exercises is worth the payoff, however the combination of the squat and overhead press skyrockets your heart rate, making it perfect for a cardio finisher.

 Dumbbell Bench Press 

 If the standard push - up is a bit too easy for you, you might need to look beyond calisthenics for building up your chest. 

 Any variation of a chest press will work just fine, but dumbbells specifically offer a few unique benefits to chest growth ( and strengthening ) that you ca not get from a barbell or a plate - loaded machine. 
 Benefits of the Dumbbell Bench Press 

     Easier to perform in a crowded facility with multiple benches. 
     Allows you to work your chest independently. 
     Provides greater freedom of movement than a barbell. 

 How to Do the Dumbbell Bench Press 

 Sit on the end of a weight bench with the dumbbells resting on your knees. Brace your core and lean backward onto the bench, simultaneously straightening your arms as you settle into the starting position. 

 From here, lower the dumbbells slowly down until they graze your chest and then return them to arm is length. 

 Coach is Tip : Press up and slightly inward. 
 Dumbbell Row 

 It may be hard to see your back without the assistance of a mirror, but, thankfully, a pair of dumbbells can help you build it just fine. The row ( and its many, many variations ) is a staple back exercise. 

 Making dumbbells your weapon of choice is wise as well — something pro physique athletes and strength enthusiasts alike are aware of. 
 Benefits of the Dumbbell Row 

     Can be performed safely with strict or loose form. 
     Great for lat and biceps recruitment. 
     Lets you even out any potential back imbalances. 

 How to Do the Dumbbell Row 

 Support your torso with your non - working arm and the corresponding knee on a bench. Use your working arm to grab a dumbbell and pull it up to your trunk. 

 Coach is Tip : Think about putting your elbows in your pockets as you row. 
 Dumbbell Shrug 

 There is really only one reliable way to beef up your traps or neck, and that is the shrug. Simply elevating and depressing your shoulders is an easy enough motion to learn, the real question involves what equipment you should turn to to get the job done. 

 [ Related : Try the Kirk Shrug for Massive Trap Gains ] 
 Benefits of the Dumbbell Shrug 

     More convenient to perform than the barbell variation. 
     Provides a strong isolated contraction to your traps. 

 How to Do the Dumbbell Shrug 

 Stand upright with a pair of dumbbells in each hand. Lean slightly forward. Strongly contract your traps by elevating your shoulders up to your ears, holding for a moment, and then lowering them back down. 

 Coach is Tip : You can alternate your reps from shoulder to shoulder or shrug both at once. 
 Dumbbell Pullover 

 There are a few exercises out there that are just a bit too useful. If you find a movement that works multiple opposing muscles at once — such as the pullover — you should stick with it, if not just for efficiency is sake. 

 Luckily, the dumbbell is the perfect tool for performing ( and perfecting ) the pullover. 
 Benefits of the Dumbbell Pullover 

     Works both your back and chest at the same time. 
     Improves your shoulder mobility provided you have good technique. 
     Provides a strong contraction with relatively light weights. 

 How to Do the Dumbbell Pullover 

 Lie on your back on a bench with your arms above you, hands clasping the plate of a dumbbell. Slowly lower it back behind your head until your arms are roughly parallel with your torso. Return the dumbbell to directly above your head. 

 Coach is Tip : Try to get the dumbbell fully out of view to ensure proper range of motion. 
 Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift 

 The hinge is one of your most foundational and essential movement patterns. You perform it on a daily basis whether you know it or not — bending over to pick up a child, or lift a crate, or even sinking into a respectful bow. 

 Training the hinge in the gym also helps you develop your hamstrings, calves, lower back, and glutes. Dumbbells are a fantastic choice if you want to make the Romanian deadlift part of your workout routine. 
 Benefits of the Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift 

     Allows for independent stimulation of your hip musculature. 
     Hits your posterior chain without requiring a heavy barbell. 
     The weights are closer to your midline, making it a bit easier on your back. 

 How to Do the Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift 

 Stand with a pair of dumbbells in your hands and your weight slightly shifted into your heels. From here, break at the hips and shoot your butt backward, allowing the dumbbells to fall down your thigh until your torso is roughly parallel to the floor. 

 Coach is Tip : Keep your head in a neutral position and do not attempt to lock your gaze on a single location as you hinge. 
 Dumbbell Fly 

 You do not have to be enamored by heavy pressing to successfully add muscle to your chest. Your pecs ’ other main anatomical function is humeral adduction, which is fancy phrasing for bringing your arm in toward your torso. 

 The fly exercise accomplishes just that, and dumbbells are the go - to piece of free weight equipment for the task. 
 Benefits of the Dumbbell Fly 

     Works your pecs through their biomechanical motion of shoulder adduction. 
     Allows you to stress your chest with light weights. 
     More convenient to perform than cable fly, which are often occupied in busy gyms. 

 How to Do the Dumbbell Fly 

 Lie on your back on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, arms straight above you. From here, open your arms slowly, palms to the ceiling. Your arms should open until they ’re roughly parallel with your torso. 

 Coach is Tip : When lifting the weights back up, think about shoving your upper arm against your torso. 
 Dumbbell Lunge 

 Squats are all well and good, but you can walk your way to strong, shapely, and powerful legs with lunges. 

 By putting one foot in front of the other, literally, and loading yourself up with a pair of dumbbells, you can stimulate almost every muscle in your lower body at once and train your balance to boot. 
 Benefits of the Dumbbell Lunge 

     Hits both your quads and glutes simultaneously. 
     Improves your balance. 
     Weights in each hand help you maintain stability.

 With a dumbbell in each hand, take a broad step outward in front of you and bend your knees to sink into a high split squat position. From here, push into the floor with your forward leg, and bring your back leg forward. Then, do the same motion with the opposing leg. Repeat. 

 Coach is Tip : Do not actively push with your back leg. Use it only to balance yourself. 
 Dumbbell Hammer Curl 

 Dumbbells are the tried - and - true default tool for arm growth in most gyms, and for good reason. You can work your biceps independently to even out imbalances and prioritize the strongest contraction possible. 

 When it comes to building the brachialis, which lies underneath your biceps proper, your first and only stop should be the dumbbell hammer curl. 
 Benefits of the Dumbbell Hammer Curl 

     Works both your upper arm and forearm at once. 
     Easy on your wrists, especially if you use a thumbless grip. 
     Can be performed alternating or simultaneously depending on preference. 

 How to Do the Dumbbell Hammer Curl 

 Stand upright ( or sitting on a bench ) with a pair of dumbbells in your hands and your arms tucked to your sides. With control, bend your elbow and curl the weights upward, keeping your wrists in a neutral position, palms facing inward. 

 Coach is Tip : You can unwrap your thumbs for a bit more forearm activation if you want to challenge your grip. 
 Dumbbell Skull Crusher 

 Skull crushers are great for beefing up the backside of your upper arms, but plenty of people find them uncomfortable to perform for one reason or another. The exercise can sometimes be awkward or painful on the wrist or elbow joints. 

 Working with dumbbells instead gives you a first - class ticket to big triceps without having to worry about your joints the whole time. 
 Benefits of the Dumbbell Skull Crusher 

     Works the long head of your triceps. 
     Friendlier for your elbows and wrists than the barbell version. 

 How to Do the Dumbbell Skull Crusher 

 Lie on your back on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand and your arms straight above your head. From here, bend at the elbow and lower the weights down toward your head, keeping your upper arms stationary. Reverse the motion and squeeze your triceps to straighten your arms. 

 Coach is Tip : You can experiment with different wrist positions to find the most comfortable posture. 
 Incline Dumbbell Curl 

 You can adjust the stimulus on your arms during a curl by changing your posture. If your arm drifts behind your body, it stretches your biceps to a great degree, forcing them to work harder when you curl. 

 You simply ca not perform this exercise with the barbell — it is not physically possible. This makes the incline dumbbell curl an indispensable tool for arm growth. 
 Benefits of the Incline Dumbbell Curl 

     Works your biceps from a unique anatomical position. 
     Creates a strong contraction with light weights. 
     Simple technique and easy to learn. 

 How to Do the Incline Dumbbell Curl 

 Set an adjustable weight bench to roughly 45 degrees or slightly higher. Lie on your back and let your arms hang straight down, a dumbbell held in each. Bend your elbows to curl the weights up high while keeping your upper arms perpendicular to the floor at all times. 

 Coach is Tip : Set the bench at a high enough angle that your arm can comfortably rest behind your torso. 
 Goblet Squat 

 Heavy, barbell - based back squats are second - to - none for leg growth and maximal strength. However, they can be intimidating to say the least. Or, you simply ca not get a hold of a squat rack in a crowded gym. 

 In either case, the goblet squat is at your disposal. It is a fantastic beginner is squatting exercise, and can also torch your quads if you ’re in a hurry. 
 Benefits of the Goblet Squat 

     Fantastic teaching tool for learning the squat movement pattern. 
     Works your quads and core simultaneously. 
     Helps maintain a more upright torso than a barbell squat. 

 How to Do the Goblet Squat 

 Stand upright, holding a dumbbell aloft in front of your chest by the plate. The weight should not be resting against your torso. From here, find your squat stance and sit downward slowly as low as you can go. Try to maintain an upright torso and balance the dumbbell in the same place. 
 Arnold Press 

 Named after bodybuilding legend himself Arnold Schwarzenegger, this specific movement is tailored perfectly for blasting your entire shoulder. Moreover, the Arnold press is a pressing variation you flat - out ca not perform with a barbell.

 How to Do the Arnold Press 

 Sit upright in a seat or bench with a pair of dumbbells in each hand. Your arms should be bent with the weights held in front of your face, palms facing you. From here, rotate your arms outward and up, pressing your arms overhead. Reverse the motion, rotating your arms back into the starting position to complete the rep. 

 Coach is Tip : Remember to rotate your arms and press the weights simultaneously instead of doing each motion separately. 
 Renegade Row 

 Combining your upper body work with some core training is wise if you ’re trying to shave time off your workout routine. 

 Luckily, you can utilize dumbbells to build up your lats and forge an ironclad set of abs at the same time with the renegade row. 
 Benefits of the Renegade Row 

     Teaches you to contract your core while you pull a weight. 
     Works your abs isometrically and your back dynamically. 
     Requires only a pair of dumbbells to perform. 

 How to Do the Renegade Row 

 Assume a standard push - up position, but instead of your palms pressed against the floor, they should be gripping a pair of dumbbells that are resting on the floor. Then, alternate your arms as you row one dumbbell up to your trunk while keeping the other arm straight. 

 Coach is Tip : Avoid twisting your torso or sagging your hips as you row. 
 Lateral Raise 

 For healthy, functional, and aesthetic shoulders, you need to train all three of the deltoid is heads. To hit the middle, or lateral, aspect of your shoulder, you have to perform the lateral raise. It is the only practical way. 

 What piece of equipment is ideally suited for the lateral raise? A pair of dumbbells. 
 Benefits of the Lateral Raise 

     One of the only ways to stimulate your side delts. 
     Easy to learn the technique.

 Coach is Tip : Raise the weights out and slightly forward for optimal deltoid contraction. 
 Wrist Curl 

 There are lots of small muscles between your elbow and wrist, and they need love too. Training your forearms takes a delicate touch since the movements you perform are equally delicate — a low amount of weight can go quite far here. 

 To train your forearms properly, turn to the dumbbell rack. 
 Benefits of the Wrist Curl 

     Targets the small muscles of your forearms. 
     Strengthens your wrists and your grip. 
     Easy to get a good workout in with very light weights. 

 How to Do the Wrist Curl 

 Sit on a bench with a pair of light dumbbells in each hand hanging down at your sides. Then, flex your wrists hard to curl the dumbbells up a bit. 

 Coach is Tip : You can rest your forearms on your thighs or find another posture that allows you to comfortably flex your wrists against the resistance of the dumbbell. 
 Benefits of Dumbbell Training 

 Dumbbells are for everyone — first - time gym goer and professional athlete alike. If you ’re wondering why they ’re so widely used in the fitness industry, rest assured that they ’re far from a fad. 

 They are not the be - all, end - all of exercise equipment, but working with dumbbells provides more than a few unique benefits that you should be mindful of. 
 Corrects Muscle Imbalances 

 By their very nature, dumbbells allow you to work each of your arms or legs independently — as well as the corresponding muscles that move those joints. 

 This allows you to identify, attack, and remedy any imbalances or side - to - side weaknesses you may have. While a barbell or fixed - path machine can sometimes mask these issues ( since you ’re moving a single piece of resistance with both your arms, for example ), dumbbells will quickly show you where your weak spots are so you can take the right actions against them. 
 Targets Weak Points 

 As the dumbbell is a single - side implement, you can think of it as more of a scalpel than a hammer. Barbell exercises are wonderful for stimulating a lot of muscles quickly and with high loads. 
 man performs concentration curl with dumbbell 

 However, barbells ca not hold a candle to the precise stimulation and resistance offered by a dumbbell. You ’d find it difficult, for instance, to properly target your side delts with another type of free weight. 
 Independent Movement 

 When working with dumbbells, your limbs have more freedom and less restriction than if you used another implement. This can be particularly helpful when performing exercises such as the bench press, where your individual anatomy strongly impacts your form. 

 No one is perfectly symmetrical side - to - side ; dumbbells allow your body to move as it was designed to, rather than having to adhere to a rigid or cumbersome path. 
 Teaches Motor Control 

 Single - arm ( or leg ) exercises do a lot more for your body than just stimulating the muscle or muscles in question. 

 When you load one limb at a time, your body still has to stabilize and control the transfer of force between the weight itself and the surface you ’re in contact with. In practical terms, this means that a single - arm press will tax your core as it attempts to stabilize your spine, providing some “ bonus ” ab training. 
 woman steadies dumbbells for overhead press 

 This principle holds true for any movement you opt to perform with, or on, one limb. 
 Builds Plenty of Strength 

 If your priority is maximal strength above all else and at any cost, you should probably spend a lot of time with the barbell — especially if you ’re aspiring toward a strength sport like powerlifting. 

 Barring that, you should not forsake dumbbells in your pursuit of getting stronger in general. They will work just fine for strength, even if you are not lifting comparably heavy weights as you would in a similar barbell - based movement. 
 Use Dumbbells to Lift Well 

 The equipment you use in the gym is less important than the sets and reps you select, which are less important than having motivation to be consistent in the first place. 

 That said, the devil is in the details when it comes to maximizing your fitness potential. Dumbbells should not make up your entire routine ( though they certainly can ) at all times, but they ’re versatile, customizable, and easy to use. 










 The Best Dumbbell Exercises For All Levels Of Gym - Goer 

 Beginner, intermediate and advanced dumbbell exercises to build muscle and strength all over your body 

 Man and woman midway through performing dumbbell exercises 

 Everyone knows at least one dumbbell exercise – curls – but there is so much more you can do with them, whether you have got a pair of adjustable dumbbells at home or a well - stocked rack of dumbbells in a gym. You can target any body part and build muscle, or string a series of movements into a pulse - raising workout to burn calories and burn fat, or work on your muscular endurance with high - rep sets. 

 Here we aim to introduce you to the essential movements everyone should master. 

 If you prefer to practise them at home, our round - up of the best dumbbells can help you find a pair to suit your budget and needs. We also have plenty of dumbbell workouts for you to try which feature the exercises on this page. But before we dive into our selection, here are a few reasons why dumbbell exercises may be the best kind of weighted exercises. 
 The Benefits Of Using Dumbbells 

 First up, dumbbells are the most accessible type of free weights and tend to be the first piece of equipment people buy to train at home, as well as a reassuringly straightforward place to start in the weights room. They are also easier to get the hang of than kettlebells – the snatch, for instance, adds another layer of complexity when done with kettlebells – and unlike barbells your wrists are not fixed in a sometimes unnatural position. 

 While barbells let you lift more weight, even if you usually gravitate towards the barbell to tackle big lifts like the back squat, deadlift and bench press, there is one key reason to make sure you also find time for dumbbell exercises. 

 “ When using a barbell, your weaker side can get an easy ride, ” says. “ You can move the weight predominantly using your stronger side, meaning one side will always lag behind. Using dumbbells nullifies this problem because each side has to work individually, meaning you will develop strength and size evenly on both sides. ” 

 There are extra benefits to dumbbell exercises beyond working the targeted muscles. “ The unstable nature of holding dumbbells also ensures that your stabiliser muscles have to work hard to keep you steady while you perform the movement. Without realizing it you will be strengthening your core and other stabiliser muscles, which can help prevent injury. ” 
 Beginner Dumbbell Exercises 
 Lateral raise 

 Man performs lateral raise with dumbbells 

 Why “ Lateral raises target the medial ( outer ) head of the deltoid muscle, ” says. “ You do not need an awful lot of core strength to perform the movement, which is why it is good for beginners. 

 How Stand holding a dumbbell in each hand next to your outer thighs. Keep your back straight and slowly lift the weights out to the sides until your arms are parallel with the floor. Your elbows should be slightly bent. Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position. 

 Form tip “ Imagine you are holding a bucket in each hand. As you raise your arms out to the side, tip the buckets as if to pour out the contents so that your thumbs point to the floor. This will ensure you hit the medial head as opposed to over - developing the front felt. ” 
 Overhead press 

 Woman performs overhead press exercise with dumbbells 

 How “ While lateral raises are good for working the delts, performing heavy overhead ( or shoulder ) presses is a great way to add serious strength, ” says. “ Make sure you do not arch your back too much. If you do you will probably end up using your upper chest instead of your shoulders. ” 

 Why You can do this either seated or standing. Hold a pair of dumbbells by your shoulders with your elbows out to the sides and bent at 90 °. Extend through your elbows and press the weights overhead, then slowly bring them back to the starting position. 
 Biceps curl 

 Woman performs biceps curls with dumbbells 

 Why “ If you ’re a beginner you may be wary of picking up heavy weights. With biceps curls you will not need to worry about that because it is not about going heavy, it is about the feel of the muscle lengthening and shortening. You can change grip to target different heads of the muscle but for a beginner I ’d recommend using a supinated grip – palms facing up. ” 

 How Hold a pair of dumbbells in front of your thighs with your palms facing out. Slowly curl the dumbbells up to your chest and then back down again. 

 Form tip “ Keep your elbows pinned to your sides, ” says. “ The minute your elbow comes up you are shifting the emphasis away from your biceps and onto your shoulders. 

 Variations Once you have mastered the basic dumbbell curl, graduate to the hammer curl with palms facing to target the brachialis muscle ( on the outside of the arm next to the biceps ). The Zottman curl is also a worthy variation to add to your repertoire to add a side of forearms work to the biceps builder. 
 Triceps kick - back 

 Man performs triceps kickback with a dumbbell 

 Why Pair this dumbbell exercise with the biceps curl to ensure you ’re working both of the major muscle groups in your upper arm. Like the biceps curl, the triceps kick - back is an isolation move, in that it targets solely the triceps. 

 How Set up a bench so you can place one knee, shin and foot on it, and then bend over until your torso is parallel to the floor, holding the bench with one hand. In the other hand, hold a dumbbell and place your upper arm against your body with your elbow bent at 90 °. Straighten your arm, moving the dumbbell backwards until your forearm is parallel to the ground, making sure to keep your upper arm still so you ’re only using your triceps for the lift. Slowly lower the weight back to the start. 
 Lunge

 Why “ Working your legs is essential for many reasons, including building strength, muscle and burning loads of calories, ” says. “ But if you ’re a beginner the thought of getting under a heavy barbell for a set of squats may seem intimidating. So instead grab a pair of dumbbells and get lunging. It is a great way to add resistance to your legs and glute work, without the fear of being left in a heap under the squat rack. ” 

 How Holding dumbbells by your sides, take a big step forwards and lower your body until both knees are bent at 90 °. Then push up through the front leg and return to the starting position. 
 Floor press 

 Man performs floor press with dumbbells 

 Why are among the fundamental movements everyone should master, and starting with dumbbells is a great option for beginners – and not just because the minimum weight you can press with a barbell is normally 20 kg. Using dumbbells will work more muscles around the shoulders and chest than using a barbell because those muscles are forced to keep the weights stable, and it is well worth developing those muscles before moving on to heavier barbells. Switching to a hammer press, with your palms facing, is a good beginner is option because it places less strain on your shoulders, as does the floor press owing to the reduced range of motion. 

 How Lie with your feet and back flat on the floor, knees bent, holding dumbbells either side of your chest. Press the weights straight above you, then lower slowly until the backs of your upper arms touch the floor. This makes the move harder, since it removes the tension from your muscles, so it takes more to initiate the next rep. 
 One - arm dumbbell row 

 Man performs one - arm dumbbell row in gym 

 Why Opting for this one - arm row to work your back over the classic bent - over row ( below ) makes it easier to focus on the side you ’re working and also to ensure your body is in the right position, because you are supporting the upper body with your other arm. 

 How Place one knee on a bench and lean over to place your hand on the bench so your upper body is parallel to the ground. Reach down with your other arm to grab the dumbbell, then row it up to your chest, focusing on lifting it with your back and shoulder muscles. Pause at the top of the move, then lower the weight slowly. 
 Calf raise 

 Woman performs calf raise holding dumbbells 

 Why Your calf muscles are among the trickiest to target during a workout. Your best option is to incorporate some kind of calf raise into your routine. This is an especially important move for runners, because the calf muscles have to bear a lot of the impact, so ensuring they ’re strong enough to handle your training should be a key concern in your supportive workouts. 

 How The calf raise is a very simple move. Stand holding heavy dumbbells, then push through your toes to raise your heels off the floor. Then lower your heels back down. You can vary the part of the calf you work by bending your knees during a raise, or doing them off a raised platform like a step or kerb, so your heels can sink below toe level. 
 Dumbbell woodchop 

 Dumbbell woodchop 

 Why This functional dumbbell exercise is terrific for core strength, with the rotational movement many of us lack in our gym routines – which often consist entirely of forward and back, up and down, and side - to - side moves. If you ’re a golfer then make sure you start woodchopping ASAP, because the increase in rotational power you will gain will add serious yardage to your drives. 

 How Stand holding a dumbbell in both hands, then lower into a squat and move moving the dumbbell to the right, until your thighs are parallel to the floor and the dumbbell is outside your right thigh. Drive up to standing and twist your torso to bring the dumbbell across and up until it is above your left shoulder, keeping your arms extended throughout. Twist to come slowly back down to the starting position. Perform all your reps in one direction, then switch sides. 
 Farmer is walk

 Why You will feel the benefits of this functional dumbbell exercise the next time you do a big shop. The farmer is walk is also great for your grip strength and will help to improve your posture, and it is a move with a very low injury risk since the form is easy to master. 

 How Hold a heavy dumbbell in each hand and walk for a set distance, like 10 m, or duration, taking short steps and keeping your core braced and torso upright – do not let the weights drag you down. 
 Intermediate Dumbbell Exercises 
 Chest fly 

 Man performs dumbbell chest fly 

 Why “ Doing chest flies is a great way to isolate the chest, ” says. “ Most pressing chest movements will enlist the help of the shoulders and triceps, but flies keep the focus purely on the chest. 

 How Lie on your back on a flat bench with your feet on the floor. Hold the dumbbells above your chest with your arms almost straight, palms facing each other. Slowly lower them out to the sides, then bring them back up above your chest. Your arms should have a slight bend in the elbows throughout. 

 Form tip “ Exaggerate the arch in your lower back slightly. This will help keep the tension on your chest as opposed to your shoulders. ” 
 Bent - over row 

 Man performs bent - over row using dumbbells 

 Why “ Using dumbbells to perform bent - over rows is a great way to ensure you develop both sides of your upper back evenly, ” says. 

 How Stand with your feet shoulder - width apart. Bend your knees and lean over from your waist, keeping your neck lined up with your spine. Let the dumbbells hang with straight arms, then slowly bring them up to your chest by squeezing your shoulders together. 

 Form tip “ Think of     – stick your bum out and ensure you maintain the natural curve in your lumbar spine ( lower back ). ” 
 Front squat 

 Woman performs squat with dumbbells in rack position 

 Why “ It is not as daunting as getting under a loaded barbell, and performing squats while holding dumbbells by your shoulders will challenge your core in a different way to the barbell version, ” says. “ Because the weight is slightly in front of you, you will place more emphasis on your quads, too. ” 

 How Hold a pair of dumbbells up by your shoulders with your elbows by your sides and palms facing each other. Lower into a squat until your thighs are parallel with the ground, then drive back up to the starting position. 
 Front raise 

 Woman performs front raise shoulder exercise with dumbbells 

 Why The first thing to know about this dumbbell exercise is that it works the front part of your shoulders. The second thing to know is that you need to use light dumbbells. You do not need much weight at all to work this area, and going too heavy risks a shoulder injury. 

 How Hold dumbbells in front of your thighs in an overhand grip, so your palms face your body. Keeping your arms extended and your back straight, lift the weight in front of you to shoulder height, then lower it slowly. You can lift two dumbbells simultaneously or work one arm at a time. 
 Arnold Press 

     demonstrates the Arnold press 

 Why Everyone starts to think they ’re the Terminator after a few good lifting sessions, so here is a move the Terminator himself made famous. The Arnold Press works all three sections of your deltoids – or machine - gun stabilisers, as we ’re sure  the Austrian Oak refers to them – and keeps your muscles under tension for longer than a standard overhead press. 

 How Stand holding dumbbells in front of your chest using an underhand grip, as though you ’re midway through a biceps curl. Open your arms out to the sides while rotating your wrists 180 ° then, without pausing, press the dumbbells above your head. 
 Plank drag 

 Woman performs plank drag with dumbbell 

 Why The plank drag is a simple and effective way to increase the difficulty of the classic plank by adding movement to test your balance and force your core muscles to resist your torso rotating as you reach and pull. 

 How Set up in a high plank position, supporting your body on your hands and toes while forming a straight line from your neck to your heels. Position the dumbbell on the floor, level with your chest on your left side. While maintaining your plank position, reach across and under with your right hand to grab the dumbbell and drag it under your body over to your right side. Then put your right hand back down and drag the weight the other way with your left hand. Make sure to engage your abs when dragging the weight so it is not just your arms doing the work. 
 Advanced Dumbbell Exercises 
 Split squat 

 Woman performs split squat with dumbbells 

 Why “ These are tough at the best of times but performing them with a dumbbell in each hand will take it to a whole new level, ” says. “ You will feel every muscle in your legs and glutes working hard just to stabilise yourself. 

 How Get into a staggered stance, holding dumbbells by your sides. Using your legs, slowly lower as far as feels comfortable, then push back up to the starting position. For a tougher variation of the split squat, put your back foot on a bench. 

 Form tip “ Keep your chest up throughout the movement. Push up through your heels as opposed to your toes to target the quads and glutes instead of your calves. ” 
 Chest pull - over 

 Man performs dumbbell pull - over exercise in a gym 

 Why “ This is a great way to finish off a chest workout and target the upper and inner sections of your chest, ” says. 

 How Lie on your back on a bench, holding a dumbbell in both hands above your head. Keep your arms straight but not locked. Slowly lower the dumbbell behind your head until you feel a stretch in your chest. Return to the start position and squeeze your chest hard at the point of contraction. 
 Dumbbell snatch 

 Man and woman demonstrate different positions of the dumbbell snatch exercise 

 Why The snatch is a full - body exercise which also requires you to execute the triple extension at the ankles, knees and hips – the type of explosive movement that will give you the edge when playing sport. 

 How Stand holding a dumbbell in one hand. Lower into a squat and touch the dumbbell to the floor between your feet. Then drive your hips forwards to stand up and lift the weight explosively. Once it reaches chest height, flip your wrist under the dumbbell and then push it above your head until your arm is fully extended. Do it right and the final press will be a fluid extension of the move using the momentum created by your legs and hips. If you have to press the weight overhead using mostly your arm, then get your technique checked and/or use a lighter weight. 
 Single - leg Romanian deadlift 

 Woman performs single - leg Romanian deadlift with a dumbbell 

 Why This fantastic functional move trains each leg in turn to mimic the movement of running, and it also helps to build a strong posterior chain. It is also an incredibly frustrating move at times, because it tests your balance as well as your strength. 

 How Stand holding dumbbells, using a lot less weight than you would for a two - footed deadlift. Lift one foot off the ground and hinge forwards at the hips, raising your foot behind you for counterbalance, to lower the weights towards the floor. Stop when you feel a stretch in your standing leg is hamstring and snap your hips forwards to come back up to standing. 
 Renegade row 

 Man performs renegade row using dumbbells 

 Why The most demanding dumbbell row asks you to hold a plank while pulling the weights up to your chest – a stern test, especially if you do not rush your reps. 

 How Use dumbbells with hexagonal weights to provide a firm base, otherwise you risk turning your wrists. Get into the top press - up position, holding the handles of the dumbbells with your hands under your shoulders and spreading your feet wide to ensure a stable base. Brace your core and keep your torso as still as possible throughout the move. Lift one dumbbell towards your chest, keeping your arm close to your body. Lower under control, then repeat on the other side. Continue, alternating sides. 
 Thruster 

 Man performs thruster exercise with dumbbells 

 Why A dumbbell thruster is a fiery little move – literally, because you will feel the burn in a lot of different muscles. It is also a great way to build up to the barbell thruster and to iron out any strength imbalances. 

 How Stand holding dumbbells at shoulder height with your palms facing. Your feet should be shoulder - width apart with your toes pointing slightly outwards. Squat down slowly, then explode up, thrusting the dumbbells above your head so that your arms are extended. Work on making the action from the bottom of the squat one fluid movement – it should not be a squat followed by an overhead press. 
 Dumbbell reverse fly 

 Woman performs reverse fly with dumbbells 


 This challenging shoulder exercise should be done with light weights to make sure you do not pull your body out of position during the move. Stand holding a weight in each hand with your palms facing. Hinge forwards at your hips and let the weights hang down beneath you. Keeping a slight bend in your elbows, lift the weights out to the sides, then bring them back down slowly. The reverse fly is a great move for working the side and rear parts of your shoulders and will help you build a broader upper back. 
 Dumbbell FAQs 
 Can you build muscle with dumbbells? 

 You sure can, although it is less to do with the type of weight, and more to do with getting the heaviness, reps and sets right. Our guide to hypertrophy training will help, but broadly speaking, to build muscle perform a weighted exercise between 10 - 15 times – 12 is typical – using a weight which makes the final rep a challenge. Rest, then repeat that sequence for a total of two or three times. 









 Are dumbbell exercises good weight exercises? 

... You betcha. 

 When done with good form, dumbbell exercises are among the simplest and best weight exercises we can do for our bodies. An easy way to start or develop your strength training, dumbbell workouts can help build and sculpt muscle throughout your whole body, by incorporating everything from back exercises to waist exercises and tricep exercises.  

 While the humble dumbbell is often overlooked in favor of the kettlebell or barbell, experts say they can be just as effective at building strength. Whether you 're getting busy with a gym workout and want a refresher on the best dumbbell exercises to do or you 're giving the home gym equipment some use in between meetings, this round - up is for you. 

 ' Probably the biggest benefit is they ’re versatile and relatively space - efficient, '     says. ' Especially after the lockdowns, I have a newfound respect for any piece of equipment my clients can afford and have space for. ' 

 When it comes to training with dumbbells vs resistance training machines, many personal trainers will prioritise dumbbell or free weight exercises because they allow for more functional training. In other words, they allow for the freedom of movement that more closely mimics real - life actions. 

 For example, they will force you to use stabiliser muscles like your core to maintain good form. Dumbbell exercises also allow you to train in multiple planes of motion ( PT - speak for multiple directions : think forward and reverse lunges, lateral lunges and curtsy lunges ). 

 Here is a look at a few more benefits. Dumbbells : 

     Are versatile – they can be used for pretty much any exercise or strength level, from Pilates and reformer Pilates, to Olympic weightlifting 
     Allow you to exercise in different planes of motion 
     Force you to use stabiliser muscles, as well as muscles you 're working 
     Are great for unilateral training ( working one side at a time ) 
     Can be safer when training alone ( unlike barbells, which often require a spotter ) 
     Are easy to store at home, even in a small space 

 OK, but can you really build muscle with dumbbells only? 

 In short, yup. ' Muscular hypertrophy - the nature of growing and increasing muscle size - is dependent on many factors, and the equipment is just one of them, ' says    , personal trainer at The Training Room. 

 ' Dumbbells have the capacity to go up to a high amount of weight, therefore the ability to overload your muscles is great ( you could also incorporate a type of set called drop sets, if you do not have heavier weights, to increase the time your muscles spend under tension ). You could also argue that, in certain movements, dumbbell exercises provide a greater range of motion and improve mobility, therefore helping you to get a good, forceful contraction and really place stress on your muscle fibres leading to growth. ' 

 Of course, there are other factors involved – including good nutrition – but getting yourself a pair of these dumbbells is a good start. 

 Can you build muscle with dumbbells at home? 

 Unless you have been featured on MTV Cribs, it is unlikely you 're blessed with the same space to train at home as the gym offers. But if you ca not make it out of the house for a gym workout, whether you 're busy with work, a new parent or you 're trying especially hard not to get Covid, dumbbells will be your saving grace. ' They work the entire body — no other equipment required, ' says    , personal trainer at The Training Room. 

 ' As you probably will not have a large variety of weights at home, one of the best ways to train is to combine exercises in what is called " supersets ". If you perform dumbbell exercises back to back, it challenges your body more. ' 

 For example, 8 - 12 reps of a bent - over row followed straight away with 8 - 12 reps of a dumbbell squat, and then 60 - 90 seconds of recovery before moving onto new exercises constitutes a superset. 
 Can dumbbell workouts help me lose weight? 

  Provided you ’re in a calorie deficit ( burning more calories than you 're consuming ) you will lose weight,     says. 

 ' Doing resistance training ( with dumbbells, in this case ) will help you build shape and tone your muscles. It will also ensure you ’re losing body fat and not muscle mass. Finally, by stimulating your muscles with resistance training you will also raise your metabolism while you recover. ' 

 What we will say, is that your weight does not define you. Also, in case you missed it, muscle weighs more than fat, so looking at your body composition could be a better way of keeping track of your health, rather than standard scales.

 Back Squat 

 Back squats are like the holy grail of strength training. They train one of the most foundational movement patterns humans can possibly engage in. We squat to sit down. We squat to talk to kids. We squat to … um … use the facilities. We are literally always squatting in day - to - day life. 

 What muscles do back squats work? 

 The primary movers for back squats include all of the muscles involved in hip flexion and extension, which include the quadriceps, hamstrings, hip abductors ( glutes ), and hip adductors ( inner thighs ). Hip extension is the opening or lengthening of your hips, while hip flexion is the closing or shortening of your hips — think bringing your knee to your chest ( flexion ) and then putting it back down ( extension ). Your calves, feet, core, back, and even your arms and shoulders engage during barbell back squats. 

 Benefits of back squats 

 Barbell back squats are one of the best exercises to help you build strength. They strengthen your entire posterior chain, teach you how to maintain a strong core, increase hip and ankle mobility, and contribute to muscle growth in your lower body. 

 How to do a back squat : 

     Setup : Rack a bar on a squat rack or power cage at about shoulder height. Add your weight plates. 
     Starting position : Unrack the barbell onto your shoulders and take a couple steps back from the rack. Stand with your feet shoulder - width apart ( approximately ) ; keep a firm grip on the bar with both hands. Position your gaze forward, take a deep breath, and brace your core. 
     Eccentric ( lowering ) phase : Keeping your eyes forward and feet flat on the floor, descend into the bottom of the squat with control. While ass - to - grass squats are great, we recommend only descending as far as your current mobility allows without your heels peeling up from the floor or your chest caving forward. 
     Concentric ( standing ) phase : Once you reach your depth, drive through your heels to return to the standing position. Make sure to avoid caving at the knees. The ascent should be one fluid motion — do not segment the squat by extending your knees before your hips or vice versa.  
     Finish : Once you finish your set, walk the bar back to the squat stand and rack it.

 Front Squat 
 front squat 

 Just like back squats, front squats are still a foundational movement pattern, except the load is supported by the front of your body instead of the backside. Lots of people avoid front squats, and they do so because they just do not like them. And we ca not blame ‘ em — front squats are painful ! I do not like promoting the “ no pain, no gain ” culture, but honestly, you will rarely walk away from a set of front squats without a burn. Just know you will be a better person for it. 

 What muscles do front squats work? 

 The primary movers are the same as for back squats : quads, hamstrings, hip abductors, and adductors. However, you will find that front squats require more core engagement and also tax your shoulders, arms, lats, and upper back significantly more than back squats. This is due to the front - rack position of the bar. 

 Benefits of the front squat 

 In addition to gaining strength and muscle in your legs, front squats have the added benefit of sparing your lower back from a load it may not be ready for. By displacing the weight onto the anterior ( front ) side of your body, you basically force your body to use your legs and core — not your back — to lift the weight.   

 How to do the barbell front squat : 

     Setup : Just like for back squats, rack your barbell on a squat stand or power cage. You may have to lower the J - cups slightly because you ’re unracking the bar onto the front of your body now. 
     Starting position : Unrack the barbell into the front - rack position ( bar rests across front of shoulders ; elbows point forward, palms face upward ; and fingers wrap around the top of the bar ). Position your feet hip- to shoulder - width apart and engage your core. 
     Eccentric ( lowering ) phase : Just like back squats, descend to your deepest range of motion without tipping forward or bringing your heels up from the ground. Keep your elbows parallel to the ground and your eyes forward. 
     Concentric ( standing ) phase : Drive through your heels to stand up, pushing your knees outward to avoid caving in. 
     Finish : Fully extend your hips at the top and carefully re - rack the barbell. 


 Barbell Romanian Deadlift 

 The almighty deadlift : The epitome of “ pick heavy things up, put them down. ” The deadlift is perhaps the simplest, yet still sexiest, lift of them all. Do not confuse simplicity with ease, though, Amanda warns. Just because the deadlift looks easy does not mean it is, and there is actually a lot that can go wrong ( especially when you ’re going heavy ). Follow our tips and step - by - step instructions below to master the deadlift. 

 What muscles do deadlifts work? 

 All of them. Every last muscle. Even the tiny ones you did not know you had. If you think you ’re just working your lower back, you ’re doing it wrong. Kidding … but not. 

 When you do deadlifts, you should feel it in your glutes and hamstrings more than your lower back. And if you ’re doing heavy deadlifts, you will also feel it in your upper back, traps, forearms, core, shoulders, lats, and every other part of your body that helps to support the weight of the barbell as you pull it off of the ground. 

 That said, your primary movers for the deadlift are the muscles responsible for hip extension : hamstrings and glutes.

 Benefits of the Romanian deadlift 

 People who deadlift well can also do a lot of other things well that the average person struggles with. Take moving for example. How much easier do you think moving a couch or a king - sized mattress is for someone who deadlifts versus someone who does not? 

 Deadlifts develop strength and muscle mass in your hamstrings, glutes, and back — and more importantly, practicing deadlifts teaches you how to use that strength safely and properly. 

 How to do the Romanian deadlift : 

     Setup : Load a barbell with weight plates on the floor. Use standard - sized Olympic plates for the best deadlift bar setup. 
     Starting position : Walk up to the barbell like you ’re about to absolutely hulk - smash it. Position your feet so that the bar hovers over your midfoot and sits close to your shins. Your feet should be stacked beneath your hips. Hinge at the hips and grip the barbell ( double overhand grip for badasses and reverse grip for babies … ) with your hands just outside your legs. 
     Concentric ( lifting ) phase : Drive through your heels and engage your glutes and hamstrings to pull the weight off of the ground. Keep your spine in the neutral position ( no arching or rounding ) and push your hips forward until you reach full hip extension. 
     Eccentric ( lowering ) phase : With control and maintaining your neutral spine, lower the barbell back to the ground by hinging at your hips, then your knees, to create one fluid motion. 
     Finish : The rep is finished once the weight plates touch the ground ; you can either do touch - and - go reps or reset entirely. 

  

 How to do sumo deadlifts : 

     Setup : The setup is the same as for conventional deadlifts — use Olympic weight plates and load the bar on the ground.  
     Starting position : Common among powerlifters, sumo deadlifts recruit more from the glutes than the hamstrings. Assume a wide ( very wide ) stand with your feet. Think about it like you ’re going to do a standing straddle stretch. Position the bar so it hovers above your midfoot and sits very close to your shins. Grip the barbell with your hands shoulder - width apart, in between your legs. 
     Concentric ( lifting ) phase : Squeeze your glutes and pull the bar off the ground using strength from your hamstrings and glutes. Keep the bar close to your body and pull until you reach full hip extension. 
     Eccentric ( lowering ) phase : After you fully stand up with the weight, lower it back to the ground. 
       

 Hip Thrust 

 There is one unspoken rule about hip thrusts : Do not make eye contact with anyone doing them. So it is a good thing you have a home gym because no one will be there to awkwardly shuffle by you as you grunt out your last set of hip thrusts. 

 What muscles do hip thrusts work? 

 Despite being a totally awkward exercise, hip thrusts are one of the best for developing lower body strength and gaining muscle, specifically in the glutes. All of your glute muscles ( maximus, medius, minimus ) get some action here. Your hamstrings also contribute, and your quads, core, and back acts as stabilizing and supporting muscles. 

 Benefits of the hip thrust 

 Well, there is the obvious benefit : a nice butt. A lot of people do hip thrusts solely for that reason. They ’re arguably the best exercise for targeting the glute muscles with heavy weight. However, hip thrusts offer non - aesthetic benefits, too. For starters, they ’re great for developing the power needed for Olympic weightlifting ( snatches and clean and jerks ). They also play a role in eliminating muscle imbalances, and lots of coaches will program them for athletes who display quad dominance. 

 How to do the hip thrust : 

     Setup : You will need a bench or box ( recommend padding a box ) along with your barbell and weight plates. Set up the bench or box so it is sturdy and level. Use a bar pad or folded yoga mat to protect your hip bones from the weight of the bar. 
     Starting position : Sit on the ground with your upper back resting against the bench. Roll the barbell toward your hips and position it so that it hovers above the crease of your hips. Put both hands on the bar ; press your back into the bench ; lift your hips so the barbell hovers above the ground ; and position your feet at a comfortable distance from from the bench, keeping them slightly wider than hip - width apart. 
     Concentric ( lifting ) phase : Squeeze your glutes and press your hips upward to lift the barbell. The range of motion on this exercise is fairly small, so you may not feel like you move very far. Squeeze until your hips fully extend and your body makes a bridge with the ground. Be careful not to hyperextend your back. 
     Eccentric ( lowering ) phase : Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position by bending your hips. Make sure to keep your feet flat on the floor and keep your core engaged throughout the entire movement. 
     Finish : Once you finish your set, carefully lower yourself and the barbell to the ground and roll the barbell away so you can stand up. 

 Overhead Press 

 Press it overhead, bring it back down. Simple enough, right? Actually, many people are surprised to learn that the overhead press is one of the most challenging barbell exercises and that a lot more goes into it than simply extension of the arms. 

 What muscles do overhead presses work? 

 Your deltoids are primarily responsible for pressing a barbell overhead. Your triceps and pecs also play a role in the pressing motion, while your back muscles ( especially your lats ) help to control the barbell on the descent. Your core and glutes should also be isometrically involved the entire time to keep your spine where it needs to be. 

 Benefits of overhead presses 

 Boulder shoulders, dudes ! The classic overhead press — also called strict press or military press — develops the delts like few other movements. In addition to aesthetics, overhead presses can help improve shoulder mobility and upper back mobility, as well as strengthen the muscles that protect delicate shoulder joints from damage.  

 How to do overhead presses : 

     Setup : Set up a bar and weights on a squat stand or power cage at a height you can comfortably unrack it from. 
     Starting position : Unrack the barbell into the front - rack position and step back from the stand. Plant your feet firmly, take a deep breath, and brace your core. Keep in mind that the front - rack position here is different than in front squats. For strict presses, you will want to point your elbows slightly outward and down at about 45 degrees, versus forward and at 90 degrees in the front squat. 
     Concentric ( pressing ) phase : Keeping your gaze forward and spine neutral ( no hyperextending ), press the barbell overhead until your elbows fully extend. 
     Eccentric ( lowering ) phase : Bend at the elbows to lower the bar back to your collarbones — with control, lest you wake up with bruises you have to explain to your mom and your significant other.  
     Finish : As soon as the bar makes contact with your shoulders / collarbone, you can go in for another rep. When you ’re done, re - rack the bar or drop it to the hang position ( holding at the hips ) before dropping it to the floor. 

 Bench Press 

 A staple in powerlifting and bodybuilding alike, the bench press is probably the most dude - bro lift of all time. This is for good reason : It is one of the most effective exercises for strength and hypertrophy in the upper body. 

 What muscles does bench press work? 

 Prime movers during bench press include your pecs, triceps, and anterior deltoids ( front of your shoulders ). Your lats are involved in the lowering portion of the lift. 

 Benefits of the barbell bench press 

 The humble bench press grows your pecs, deltoids, and triceps, and it also shreds your serratus muscles — those small muscles that sit atop your upper ribs and make you look absolutely shredded when they ’re visible. More importantly, the bench press improves your upper body pushing strength, which would come in handy if you ever ran out of gas and had to push a car or something. 

 How to do the barbell bench press : 

     Setup : Slide your bench into position in the middle of your power rack. Rack the barbell and weights at a height you can comfortably reach from the bench. 
     Starting position : Positioning for bench press varies a lot among people, but in general, you should situate yourself on the bench so that you can reach the bar without locking out your elbows ( because you will need some leverage to unrack it ), and so that your feet can touch the floor. Grip positioning varies based on anatomy and preferences, but should fall around shoulder - width. 
     Eccentric ( lowering ) phase : Unrack the bar and hold it above your chest with your elbows fully extended. Keeping your wrists strong, bend at the elbows to lower the barbell until it touches your chest. The barbell should make contact somewhere between the lower pec muscles and sternum. Generally, the narrower your grip, the lower on your torso that contact point will be. 
     Concentric ( pressing ) phase : Recruit your pecs, shoulders, and triceps to press the bar back up to the starting position. 
     Finish : The rep is complete when your elbows fully extend. Rerack the bar by guiding it backward into the J - cups on your power rack.

 Bent Over Row 

 Bent - over rows are a must - have in your routine for strong, developed back muscles. They ’re simple but effective. 

 What muscles do bent - over rows work? 

 Your lats and spinal erector muscles are the main movers for the barbell bent - over row. Many other muscles directly support the rowing movement pattern, including your rhomboids ( which retract your shoulder blades ), traps ( which depress and raise your shoulder blades ), your deltoids, biceps, and other small muscles throughout your back. Your hips and glutes are engaged isometrically while you ’re in the hip - hinge position. 

 Benefits of the barbell bent - over row 

 Bent - over rows are ideal for increasing strength in your upper and mid - back, which can transfer to the skills you need for movements like pull - ups. Developing those upper and mid - back muscles also assists your ability to hold onto the bar during heavy deadlifts and complete the pull - on power cleans and snatches. 

 How to do the barbell bent - over row : 

     Setup : Load a barbell on the ground with Olympic weight plates. 
     Starting position : Stand with your feet beneath the barbell as if you ’re setting up for a deadlift. Grab the bar with a double overhand grip ( double underhand if you want to target more biceps and rhomboids ), with your hands shoulder - width apart and palms facing down. You should be in a hip - hinge position with your back straight. 
     Concentric ( rowing ) phase : Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together. Pull the barbell toward your torso and try to tap it to your sternum. Your elbows should travel backward and point to the sky behind you. Palms remain facing down. 
     Eccentric ( lowering ) phase : Extend your arms to lower the barbell back to the starting position. 
     Finish : There is no real resetting for this exercise ; simply go in for another rep after you lower the bar. 

 Benefits of Barbell Training 
 Coop deadlift in a garage gym 

 A barbell is perhaps the most versatile, and arguably the most important, piece of fitness equipment of all. With a barbell, you can do all of the compound exercises described above, as well as countless other multi - joint and single - joint ( isolation ) exercises. Below, Amanda and I dive into the main benefits of barbell training. 
 Increased Strength 

 Captain Obvious reporting for duty ! You probably already knew or, at the very least, suspected that barbell training increases strength. That is kind of the whole point. All types of weight training can help you get stronger, but barbells are more conducive to multi - joint lifts than dumbbells, kettlebells, cables, or other equipment. 

 “ Things like technique, load, rep scheme, volume, and, of course, genetics all affect how quickly you will gain strength from barbell training, ” Amanda says, “ but the important thing is that you ’re training with a barbell. If you are, it means you ’re in the best position to do the big compound lifts that are best for gaining strength. ” 
 Power and Explosiveness 

 In addition to raw strength, you can develop power and explosiveness if you have a barbell and some weight plates. These two skills involve fast - twitch muscle fibers and are important for movements like power cleans, jerks, snatches, throwing, sprinting, and jumping. 

 You ’re not alone if you think these things are not important, Amanda says, because most people think power and explosiveness are reserved for CrossFitters or elite athletes. In actuality, these two attributes help you develop a well - rounded arsenal of athleticism. 
 Hypertrophy 

 Yup, you can totally get jacked with just a barbell and weight plates. While dumbbells, kettlebells, resistance bands, and specialty equipment help with muscle isolation, there are plenty of barbell exercises you can do to increase muscle mass. 

 As a matter of fact, you can get all the gains you need just by doing the best barbell exercises we covered above. “ With barbell training, it does not have to be complicated, ” Amanda reminds. “ Do some pushing, some pulling, some squatting, and some hinging, and you will be well on your way to a more muscular physique. ” 
 Health and Wellness 

 On top of all those fitness benefits, the health benefits of barbell training ca not be overlooked. “ Most people pick up a barbell because they want to get strong or ripped, but they eventually learn the benefits run much deeper than that, ” Amanda says. 

 Health benefits of barbell training include : 

     Increased bone density and reduced risk of osteoporosis 
     Protection against osteoarthritis and joint pain 
     Increased lean body mass 
     Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease 
     Improved mood and increased energy levels 
     Improved mobility and flexibility 
     Increased resting metabolic rate 

 Coordination, Balance, and Stability 

 It does not matter what amount of weight you use while barbell training : Practicing the best barbell exercises above will improve the way you move in everyday life as well as other recreational pursuits. Barbell training increases body awareness, which helps you develop coordination, balance, and stability ( which is especially important as you get older ). 
 Versatility 

 Finally, barbell training is extremely versatile. This is not necessarily a physical health or fitness benefit like the others, but it is worth calling out. Because barbell training is so versatile, you ’re less likely to get bored with it compared to training solely with dumbbells or machines. There is always something new to try with a barbell. Also, you can basically progress endlessly — as long as you have enough weight plates, that is.  


 Final Verdict 

 As you can see, the best barbell exercises are those that utilize multiple joints and muscle groups at once — they’re all compound exercises.   You probably noticed a common theme : While all of the best barbell movements have a group of primary movers, the truth is, your entire body is engaged during each and every one of them. That is why these are superior for building full - body strength and supporting muscle growth. 

 Of course, there are a ton of other great barbell exercises out there. At Garage Gym Reviews, some of our favorites include Romanian deadlifts, split squats, power cleans, snatches, good mornings, and lunges ( especially of the walking variety if you ’re Amanda ; we may or may not think she is a sociopath ). But we stand by our stance that the fundamentals remain the best for most people. 
 Barbell Exercises FAQs 
 Can you build muscle with just a barbell? 

 Barbell training is one of the best ways to build muscle. You can absolutely build muscle with a just barbell, although most people will outgrow a 35- or 45 - pound bar pretty quickly. It helps to have weight plates, of course. With a barbell and plates, you can continually challenge yourself by adding weight, and your body will respond by building more muscle. 
 What muscles do barbells work? 

 You can work literally any and every muscle with a barbell. You can do compound exercises or isolation exercises to target specific muscle groups or work your whole body. There are virtually endless options for lower body and upper body barbell exercises for you to choose from. 
 What is the hardest barbell exercise?  

 The hardest barbell exercise is relative — what is hard for one person may not be hard for the next. In general, people struggle more with compound exercises due to the necessary mobility aspect. For example, it is common for people to struggle to reach full depth on barbell squats or struggle to lock their arms out in an overhead press. 
 Do barbell squats burn fat? 

 While you ca not burn fat from your stomach just, squatting burns fat while also building muscle. Heavy squats improve your lean muscle mass, which enhances your capacity to burn calories at rest throughout the day. While squats primarily develop strength and power, heavy squats increase your lean muscle mass, which increases your ability to burn calories at rest throughout the day. 









 barbell training is a one - stop - shop for strength, more muscle mass, fat loss, and power. That is because you can load up the barbell with more weight than kettlebells and dumbbells can provide. The almighty barbell — which has a rich history in strength sports — can also be used in various ways — you can squat it, press it, load it on your back or your front, and even jump with it. 

 The thing is, there are so many exercises available today that knowing which to focus on if you ’re new to using barbells can be overwhelming.

 1. Barbell Back Squat 

 The back squat is called the “ king of all exercises ” for a reason. Squatting with a heavy barbell on your back allows you to overload your leg muscles with more weight than you could with other tools. Your core works overtime as you brace to ensure that your torso is rigid throughout the movement ( which promotes a stable and safe spine ). And your back, which is supporting the physical load, will also reap some strength gains. 
  

 Back squats are also great for both heavy, low - rep training or lighter, high - rep training. Higher rep squats ( and lower rep but not to the same extent ) cause the body to produce more growth hormones that trigger the effect of increasing your overall size and strength, as well as improving your explosive power. ( 1)(2 ) 
 How to Do It 

     Step under a barbell and set a good foundation by flexing your core to lift the barbell off the squat rack. 
     Grip the barbell wherever allows you optimal shoulder mobility to get your elbows under the bar. 
     Set it either high or low on your upper back, unrack it, and take a few steps back. 
     Pull the bar down into your shoulders to create tension. 
     Keep your chest up, take a deep breath in and squat down to a comfortable depth and pause for a beat. 
     Drive your feet through the floor until lockout. 

 Coach is Tip : Take time to experiment with stance width and foot position to find something comfortable for you. 

 Sets and Reps : Try 3 sets of 6 - 8 reps. 
 2. Barbell Front Squat 

 You may be thinking, “ wait, do we really need two squats on this list? ” Yes, and here is why : Though they ’re both squatting patterns, the front squat has you support the barbell in the front rack position, resting across your shoulders. 

 This position takes the load off your back, reduces spinal compression, and forces you to contract your upper back muscles better to prevent the bar from falling forward mid - lift. Compared to the back squat, the front squat trains the body is anterior muscles more heavily, engaging the quads and anterior core to a greater degree. 
 How to Do It 

     Assume a proper front rack position by putting the barbell high up onto the shoulders, ensuring the bar is supported with the shoulders and upper chest. 
     Keep your shoulders down and chest up and take three steps back from the rack. 
     Descend into a squat keeping the back in neutral while minimizing forward lean of the torso. 
     Once you have hit the bottom position, push through the whole foot and stand up, maintaining an upright torso, chest, and forward elbow position. 

 Coach is Tip : Think about “ showing your armpits ” to the mirror in front of you to maintain your front rack. 

 Sets and Reps : Go for 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps. 
 3. Barbell Rack Pull 

 The rack pull is a deadlift variation similar that trains all the same muscles in the standard deadlift but with a reduced range of motion ( ROM ). For rack pulls, you start with the barbell at or just below knee height. You can elevate the barbell on blocks, weight plates, or the safety arms of a power rack. 
  


 Because of the reduced range of motion, it is easier to maintain a neutral spine. Plus, you can use more weight with the rack pull, so it both acclimates your body to handle heavy loads and strengthens the top half — or lockout — of your deadlift. 
 How to Do It 

     Set the barbell up in the squat rack either above or below the knees. Assume your standard deadlift stance and grip. 
     Hinge down and grip the barbell with an overhand shoulder - width grip and squeeze your armpits together, keep your chest up and shoulders back. 
     Pull up until lockout, finishing with your glutes. 
     Hinge back to the starting position and repeat. 

 Coach is Tip : Go hard and heavy here, working with more weight than you can deadlift from the floor. 

 Sets and Reps : Do 4 to 5 sets of 3 to 5 reps. 
 4. Barbell Romanian Deadlift 

 This is our second deadlift variation on the list, and there is a reason we chose both over the conventional version. Regarding the Romanian deadlift, it is a bit more specific and beginner - friendly ( similar to the rack pull. ) The move is visually very similar to the standard deadlift, but the RDL has you lower the bar to about mid - shin level instead of back to the floor.  

 This slight tweak keeps tension on the glute and hamstring muscles, making it a better option to isolate those areas and on the lower back. A stronger lower back will carry over to your deadlift and help prevent spinal rounding ( or cat - back ) during heavy pulls. The RDL is also generally safer as it does not allow you to use much weight as your standard deadlift. 
 How to Do It 

     Stand tall with your feet hip - distance apart and grip the barbell with an overhand grip in front of the thighs. 
     With your chest up and shoulders down, take a deep breath in and hip hinge until the barbell is below your knees. Always keep the barbell close to your body. 
     Pause for a second and exhale and use your hamstrings and glutes to pull you back to a standing position. Reset and repeat. 

 Coach is Tip : Think about pushing your butt back toward an invisible wall behind you while you hinge. 

 Sets and Reps : Try 2 or 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. 
 5. Barbell Bench Press 

 The bench press and all its variations ( incline, decline, close - grip, with dumbbells, and the floor press ) target the chest, triceps, and shoulders. Like most barbell exercises, it allows you to use a greater load ( because of the relatively straight bar path and the stability of the bench ) than you could muster with kettlebells or dumbbells. 
  

 For powerlifters, this move is a must - do as it is one of the three main competition lifts ( the other two being the back squat and deadlift ). 
 How to Do It 

     Lie flat on your back on a weight bench and get your eyes directly underneath the barbell. 
     Grip the bar with hands wider than shoulder - width apart with a neutral wrist. 
     Bring your feet closer to your glutes, push your feet back and un - rack the bar in the lockout position. 
     Then bring the bar slowly down to your chest, pause for a moment, and press it back to the starting position. 

 Coach is Tip : The bar path of a bench press is not straight up and straight down ; press up and backward slightly so the bar ends directly over your shoulders. 

 Sets and Reps : Try 4 sets of 8 reps. 
 6. Barbell Bent - Over Row 

 The bent over row is a fantastic exercise to strengthen and increase mass in the upper back and lats and reinforce good hip hinge mechanics. Because you ’re in a hip hinge position, this trains the lower back isometrically, making it a great accessory exercise to improve your deadlift. 
 Bent - Over Row GIF 

 The bent - over row is a horizontal row variation that allows you to use the most weight. In most cases, more weight equals more muscle and strength. 
 How to Do It 

     Put a loaded barbell on the floor stand with your feet slightly more than hip - width apart. 
     Hinge down to the barbell and grab the barbell with a shoulder - width grip. 
     Then bring the barbell up to knee level with back straight and torso bent at 45 degrees. 
     Pull the barbell to between your navel and sternum. Pause, then slowly lower the barbell back down and repeat. 

 Coach is Tip : Your torso should be between parallel to the floor and a 45 - degree angle. 

 Sets and Reps : Try 3 or 4 sets of 8 to 12 reps. 
 7. Barbell Push Press 

 The overhead press is a fantastic shoulder exercise, no doubt. But how often do you find yourself not moving your lower body to get something overhead? The push press uses the triple extension of the ankles, knees, and hips, which closely mimics what most overhead athletes do on the field and you do at home or the gym. 
  

 Plus, the lower body dip allows you to lift more weight overhead than the barbell overhead press. Lifting more weight overhead allows for more muscle and strength. 
 How to Do It 

     Stand in front of a loaded barbell, set to about chin - height in a power rack. 
     Grab the bar with a grip that is slightly wider than shoulder - width. 
     Brace your abs, dip your knees a little bit, and then explosively push the bar overhead. 
     Catch the bar gently on your chest and then repeat. 

 Coach is Tip : Think about initiating the movement with just your legs and pressing with your arms only after the bar clears your head. 

 Sets and Reps : Go for 4 to 5 sets of 3 to 5 reps. 
 8. Barbell Hip Thrust 

 Using the hip thrust will build both strength and mass in your glutes. Though the glutes are worked during the back squat and deadlift, the hip thrust is as close to an isolation movement as exists for the glutes. 
 A person doing the hip thrust exercise in the Barbed gym. 

 And honing in on the glutes will carry over to those movements and make you a more efficient runner, jumper, and sprinter.   Plus, you will look great in your favorite pair of pants. 
 How to Do It 

     Sit with your back up against the edge of a bench that is parallel to you. 
     With padding across your pelvis, roll a loaded barbell into the crease of your hips. 
     Once the barbell is secure, drive your feet and back towards the bench. You want your shoulder blades to be on the bench and upper body and hips in a straight line. 
     Keep your upper body steady as you lower your hips toward the ground and when extending into lockout. 

 Coach is Tip : Actively drive your upper back against the bench as you thrust. 

 Sets and Reps : Do 4 sets of 12 to 15 reps. 
 9. Barbell Floor Press 

 The barbell floor press is a great option for lifters looking to strengthen the top portion of their press. By pressing a barbell from the floor, you ’re limiting your range of motion and focusing more on triceps and lockout strength. 

 This means you can typically press more weight than other dumbbell bench press variations. That can equate to a stronger bench press and bigger triceps. This is always a great option when all the benches are taken, or you need to work around shoulder issues. 
 How to Do It 

     Lie down in front of a power rack. Extend your arms. Adjust the hooks so that the barbell sits where your hands reach. 
     Plant your feet firmly on the floor. 
     Grab the bar with your typical bench press grip. 
     Lift the bar out of the rack. Lower it to your sternum. Keep your elbows tucked in at 45 degrees. Press back up. 

 Coach is Tip : Lower the weight down until your elbows barely touch the floor. Make gentle contact. 

 Sets and Reps : Try 2 sets of 12 to 15 reps. 
 10. Barbell Biceps Curl 

 There are many biceps curl variations, but the barbell biceps curl is the granddaddy of them all. If your wrists and elbows are healthy, this variation will allow you to curl more weight and increase strength and mass. 

 Bicep strength plays an important role in pulling from the floor and row and pull - up variations. If your biceps are a weak link, then you will not get the best out of these exercises. Strengthening them allows you to build more strength and mass with these pulling exercises. 
 How to Do It 

     Hold a barbell with an underhand grip. Your hands should be slightly wider than hip - width. 
     Keep your shoulders back and down. Curl the barbell up towards your shoulders. 
     Let your elbows drift forward while locking your shoulder in place. 
     Pause and squeeze your biceps at lockout. Slowly lower, keeping a tall posture. Reset and repeat. 

 Coach is Tip : Keep your upper arms pinned tightly to your sides and do not sway at the hips. 

 Sets and Reps : Do 4 sets of 6 to 8 repetitions. 
 11. Barbell Hang Clean 

 The hang clean is similar to the power clean, which is a staple in most high school, college, and professional weight rooms. But the hang clean has a shorter learning curve. This is because you will generate power from a friendlier low back position. 
 A person doing barbell hang clean exercises in the Barbed gym. 

 This exercise still requires a powerful hip drive, a strong pull, and dip and catch — just like the power clean. And the hang clean will still build slabs of upper back strength and mass. Plus, it is less stressful on the lower back, which is great if you tend toward low back pain. 
 How to Do It 

     Stand tall with the barbell at arm is length with an overhand grip. Place your feet shoulder - width apart. 
     Hinge at your hips until the bar is at knee height. Push your feet into the floor and explosively pull the barbell. 
     Keep your chest up and the barbell close to your body. Pull until the bell is in your hip crease. 
     Snap your hips forward and pull the bar up to your shoulders. 
     As the bar continues up, drop into a squat. Catch the bar in the front rack position. Your elbows should be up and facing forward. 
     The barbell should be at your collarbone. Squat up until lockout. Reset and repeat. 

 Coach is Tip : Maintain balanced foot pressure as you hang, do not sit back too far onto your heels. 

 Sets and Reps : Go for 4 to 5 sets of 2 to 4 repetitions. 
 12. Barbell Good Morning 

 Barbell good mornings are a fantastic move that trains the lower back, glutes, and hamstrings all at once. This exercise needs to be mastered with lighter loads before increasing intensity and range of motion. 
  

 When you do it right, this exercise will build and strengthen posterior chain. In turn, this will help build a stronger and healthier squat and deadlift performance. 
 How to Do It 

     Step into a squat rack. Unrack the barbell on your traps. 
     Walk out two or three steps. Hinge at your hips with a slight bend in your knees. 
     Keep your chest up and shoulders down. Hinge until your torso is almost parallel to the floor. 
     Contract your glutes and hamstrings to lift yourself to a standing position. Reset and repeat for reps. 

 Coach is Tip : Start with less weight than you think you need for good mornings. 

 Sets and Reps : Try 2 sets of 15 repetitions to begin with. 
 13. Barbell Kirk Shrug 

   shrugs got their name from the guy who first used them, world champion powerlifter. He started doing this shrug variation to improve his grip strength for the deadlift. Because this shrug variation uses a thumbless grip, the focus is on the upper back and grip strength. 

 Yes, it improved his deadlift, but it built an impressive yoke, too. If you ’re looking to build upper traps,   shrugs need to be your go - to. 
 How to Do It 

     Place a barbell at thigh height in a squat rack. Grip the barbell with a thumbless overhand grip or suicide grip. 
     Shrug the weight by using your only traps. 
     Keep your shoulders down and your chest up. Pause for a second at the navel. 
     Slowly lower the barbell down to the starting position. 

 Coach is Tip : Lean forward slightly to increase your range of motion. 

 Sets and Reps : Do 2 or 3 sets of 15 to 20 repetitions. 
 14. Barbell Overhead Carry 

 All carry variations are great, but the barbell overhead carry takes carries to a whole new level. Overhead carries puts your whole body under tension. Every step is a test of your single - leg balance. 
 A person doing performing the barbell overhead carry exercise. 

 Your upper back and traps get serious time under tension for improved muscle and strength. Plus, the barbell overhead carry improves overhead lockout strength, mental conditioning, and toughness. 
 How to Do It 

     Load the barbell with somewhere between 60 to 80 percent of your overhead press one - rep max. 
     Place your hands slightly wider than shoulder width. Press the barbell overhead. 
     Take slow, deliberate steps. Pay attention to your gait and balance. 
     Walk for 20 to 40 yards. Re - rack the barbell in the squat rack or place it on the ground. Rest and repeat. 

 Coach is Tip : Your arms should be just behind your ears in the overhead position. 

 Sets and Reps : Try 3 or 4 rounds of overhead carries. 
 15. Barbell Skull Crusher 

 The barbell skull crusher has you lower a barbell to your forehead to stretch the triceps muscle before you contract it. Exercises like the barbell skull crusher put your muscle groups through a larger range of motion. This translates into better hypertrophy potential. 









 Benefits of Barbell Exercises 
 1. They ’re ideal for gaining strength. 

 There are three main reasons barbell exercises are ideal for building strength : 

 1. One of the best ways to get stronger is to train with heavy weights. 

 When you use dumbbells, you can only progress up to the heaviest dumbbells available in your gym ( usually around 100 pounds ), but no further. 

 While this is plenty to progress on most exercises, it will not be enough to achieve progressive overload on exercises like the squat, deadlift, bench press, and dumbbell row after several years of proper training. 

 With a barbell, though, you can push, pull, and squat far more weight than you ever could with dumbbells. Not only are barbells physically stronger than dumbbells ( some can hold over 3,000 pounds ), but they also allow you to put your body in a position where you can lift heavier weights more efficiently ( for instance, the barbell squat vs the goblet squat ). 

 Thus, you can get stronger with barbell exercises far longer than you can with dumbbells. 

 2. With most barbell exercises, you ’re able to use both hands to keep the bar stable and the weight evenly distributed over both the left and right side of your body, which makes it easier to push and pull heavy loads than with dumbbells. 

 For example, in the dumbbell bench press, you have to consciously fight to keep both of your hands about the same distance from your chest, whereas this mostly takes care of itself when doing the barbell bench press. 

 3. The exercises that allow you to handle the heaviest weights, such as the squat, deadlift, and bench and overhead press, are easier to perform with a barbell. 

 You can perform these exercises with dumbbells, but once the dumbbells get heavy ( over 75 pounds ), they become unwieldy, awkward, and at times, unsafe. 
 2. They ’re adaptable. 

 Barbells can be used for many different types of exercise, including... 

     Bodybuilding 
     Powerlifting 
     Strongman 
     CrossFit 
     Olympic weightlifting 

... which means that no matter how you like to train, you can almost always use a barbell. 
 3. They allow you to perform exercises safely. 

 Because your hands are “ locked ” in position during barbell exercises, you tend to have more control over a barbell than you do when you use dumbbells, which typically makes exercises safer. 

 What is more, you often have to “ nudge, ” “ flick, ” or “ clean ” dumbbells to get them into the proper position to perform an exercise. 

 For example, in the dumbbell shoulder press, you have to lift the dumbbells onto your thighs then “ kick ” them up to shoulder height to get into the starting position. 

 Setting up like this is not so bad when the dumbbells are light, but it begins to feel unsteady and fatiguing as the weights get heavier ( usually over 50 pounds or so for men and 25 for women ). 

 Getting in position is not as precarious for most compound barbell exercises because they generally involve a power rack. This allows you to quickly get into a safe and efficient position before bearing any weight. 

 ( Using a squat rack also makes it safer to drop the bar if you happen to hit failure on most barbell exercises. ) 
 4. They allow you to increase weight in small increments. 

 Increasing the weight you lift over time — also known as progressive overload — is the most important driver of strength and muscle gain. 

 Most dumbbells go up in 5 - pound increments, which means when you increase the weight for a dumbbell exercise, you typically have to lift a minimum of 10 pounds more than you previously did ( each dumbbell weighs 5 pounds more than the previous ones you used ). 

 When you ’re new to weightlifting, 10 - pound jumps from week to week are easy. As you nudge your genetic limit for muscle and strength gain, however, you will not be able to progress this quickly, and you will need to increase the weights more gradually. 

 Most gyms have barbell plates as small as 2.5 pounds, which allow you to make smaller, more sustainable, 5 - pound increases that allow you to keep getting stronger without becoming plateaued or injured. 
 The 18 Best Barbell Exercises for Building Muscle and Strength 

 This list of barbell exercises is far from exhaustive, but it includes all of the best barbell exercises you can do for your entire body. 
 The Best Barbell Chest Exercises 
 1. Barbell Bench Press 

 barbell bench press 

 The barbell bench press is one of the single best upper - body barbell exercises you can do because it trains every major muscle group in above your waist, particularly your pecs, triceps, and deltoids. 

 How to : 

     Lie on a flat bench with your feet flat on the floor, directly under your knees. 
     Pull your shoulder blades together and down, and without lifting your butt or shoulders off the bench, slightly arch your back. 
     Grab the bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder width apart, take a deep breath, brace your core, and unrack the barbell. 
     Bring the barbell to the middle of your chest, making sure to keep your elbows tucked at about a 45 - degree angle relative to your body. 
     When the bar touches your chest, explosively press the bar back to the starting position. 

 2. Incline Barbell Bench Press 

 Incline Barbell Bench Press 

 The incline barbell bench press is one of the most effective barbell exercises for your chest because it emphasizes the oft - neglected “ upper chest. ” Including it in your chest workouts ensures you build proportionate chest mass—“filling out ” your entire pecs. 

 How to : 

     Lie on a bench that is angled at 30 - to-45 degrees and place your feet flat on the floor. 
     Pull your shoulder blades together and down, and without lifting your butt or shoulders off the bench, slightly arch your back. 
     Grab the bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder - width apart, take a deep breath, brace your core, and unrack the barbell. 
     Bring the barbell to your upper chest, making sure to keep your elbows tucked at about a 45 - degree angle relative to your body. 
     When the bar touches your chest, explosively press the bar back to the starting position. 

 3. Decline Barbell Bench Press 

 Decline Barbell Bench Press 

 Research shows that the decline barbell bench press trains the lower chest and triceps just as well as the flat barbell bench press ( though it does not train the shoulders quite so well ). This means it is a good addition to your routine if you want a break from flat benching or if you want to use the decline bench press as an accessory exercise for your pecs. 

 How to : 

     Lie on a decline bench, secure your feet under the pads ( if available ) and adjust your body so your eyes are under the bar. 
     Pull your shoulder blades together and down, and without lifting your butt or shoulders off the bench, slightly arch your back. 
     Grab the bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder - width apart, take a deep breath, brace your core, and unrack the barbell. 
     Bring the barbell to your upper chest, making sure to keep your elbows tucked at about a 45 - degree angle relative to your body. 
     When the bar touches your chest, explosively press the bar back to the starting position. 

 The Best Barbell Back Exercises 
 1. Deadlift 

 Deadlift 

 The deadlift trains every muscle in your back, though it is a particularly good lower back barbell exercise. It also allows you to use some of the heaviest weights in any of your workouts, which means it is ideal for gaining strength and muscle. 

 How to : 

     Position your feet so they ’re a bit less than shoulder - width apart with your toes pointed slightly out. Move a loaded barbell over your midfoot so it is about an inch from your shins. 
     Move down toward the bar by pushing your hips back and grip the bar just outside your shins. 
     Take a deep breath of air into your belly, flatten your back by pushing your hips up slightly, and then drive your body upward and slightly back by pushing through your heels until you ’re standing up straight. 
     Reverse the movement and return to the starting position. 

 2. Barbell Row 

 Barbell Row 

 You can generally lift more weight with the barbell row than you can with other back exercises with a barbell, which means it is a boon to any back workout for mass. 

 How to : 

     Position your feet under a loaded barbell about shoulder - width apart with your toes pointed slightly outward. 
     Bend over and grab the bar with a slightly wider than shoulder - width grip and with your palms facing toward you. 
     Straighten your back and raise your hips until your back is roughly parallel to the floor. 
     Initiate the movement by driving through your legs, then, using the momentum generated by your lower body, pull the barbell to your upper body, touching it anywhere between your lower chest and belly button. 
     Once the bar touches your body, reverse the movement and return to the starting position. 

 3. Pendlay Row 

 Pendlay Row 

 The Pendlay row is a similar compound barbell back exercise to the barbell row, except you do not use your lower body to help hoist the bar off the floor. This means you probably will not be able to lift as much weight as you do with other row variations, but it also means your lats, traps, and rhomboids do more of the work and you are not limited by your lower - body strength. 

 How to : 

     Position your feet under a loaded barbell about shoulder - width apart with your toes pointed slightly outward. 
     Bend over and grab the bar with a slightly wider than shoulder - width grip with your palms facing toward you. 
     Straighten your back and raise your hips until your back is roughly parallel to the floor. 
     Pull the barbell to your upper body, touching it anywhere between your lower chest and belly button. 
     Once the bar touches your body, reverse the movement and return it to the floor. 

 The Best Barbell Shoulder Exercises 
 1. Standing Barbell Overhead Press 

 Standing Barbell Overhead Press 

 The standing overhead press improves upper - body strength, chest, shoulder, and tricep size, and develops your whole - body balance and coordination. 

 How to : 

     Set a barbell in a rack at the same height as your upper chest. Grip the bar with a shoulder - width grip and your palms facing away from you. 
     Unrack the barbell and take a small step backwards with each foot, keeping your wrists stacked over your elbows, and your elbows tucked close to your sides. 
     Plant your feet just outside of shoulder - width, brace your core, squeeze your glutes, and push the bar off your chest toward the ceiling. 
     Once your arms are straight and your elbows are locked out, reverse the movement to return to the starting position. 

 2. Seated Barbell Overhead Press 

 Seated Barbell Overhead Press 

 The seated barbell overhead press and the standing barbell overhead press are very similar shoulder barbell exercises. However, because the seated barbell overhead press does not require as much full - body coordination, you can lift heavier weights and progress faster, which is generally better for muscle growth. 

 How to : 

     Set up an upright bench in a squat rack or power rack, or use a seated barbell press station. 
     Sit in the seat and press your back against the bench, reach your arms overhead, and take a note of the height of your wrists in relation to the rack — this is the height you should set the barbell on the hooks. 
     Set the barbell on the hooks, sit down, and grip the bar with a shoulder - width grip and your palms facing away from you. 
     Unrack the barbell and lower it to your collarbone. 
     Once the bar reaches your collarbone, press the bar toward the ceiling and return to the starting position. 

 3. Barbell Rear Delt Row 

 Barbell Rear Delt Row 

 The barbell rear delt row is a great exercise for training your rear delts, which are small, stubborn muscles that often need a bit of extra attention if you want them to grow as quickly as your other shoulder muscles. 

 How to : 

     Position your feet under a loaded barbell about shoulder - width apart with your toes pointed slightly outward. 
     Bend over and grab the bar with a slightly wider than shoulder - width grip and with your palms facing toward you. 
     Flatten your back so that it is roughly parallel to the floor and let your arms hang straight down. 
     Pull the barbell to your mid chest, making sure to flair your elbows at about a 60 - degree angle relative to your body. 
     Once the bar touches your body, reverse the movement and return to the starting position. 

 The Best Barbell Leg Exercises 
 1. Barbell Back Squat 

 Barbell Back Squat 

 The barbell back squat is hands down the most effective barbell quad exercise you can do for building size and strength. It also allows you to use very heavy weights, which maximizes tension in your muscle fibers and thus muscle growth over time. 

 How to : 

     Position a barbell in a squat rack at about the height of your nipples. 
     Step under the bar, pinch your shoulder blades together, and rest the bar directly above the bony ridges on the bottom of your shoulder blades. 
     Lift the bar out of the rack, take one or two steps backward, and place your feet a little wider than shoulder - width apart with your toes pointing slightly outward. 
     Sit down and remember to keep your back straight and push your knees out in the same direction as your toes throughout each rep. 
     Stand up and return to the starting position. 

 2. Barbell Front Squat 

 Barbell Front Squat 

 Most people think of the front squat as a quad exercise, but studies show it is one of the best barbell glute exercises you can do, too. What is more, research also shows that the front squat places considerably less compressive forces on your knees and lower back, which make it a particularly good alternative to back squats for people who have knee or back issues. 

 How to : 

     Position a barbell in a squat rack at about the height of your breast bone ( usually an inch or two higher than you would for the barbell squat ). 
     Grab the bar with a shoulder - width grip and your palms facing away from you. 
     Step closer to the bar so that it presses against the top of your breast bone and push your elbows up and out in front of the bar. 
     With the bar resting on the front of your shoulders and held in place by your hands, lift it out of the rack, take one or two steps backward, and place your feet a little wider than shoulder - width apart with your toes pointing slightly outward. 
     Sit down and remember to keep your back straight, elbows up, and push your knees out in the same direction as your toes throughout each rep. 
     Stand up and return to the starting position. 

 3. Romanian Deadlift 

 Romanian Deadlift 

 The Romanian deadlift ( RDL ) is a fantastic barbell hamstring exercise because it allows you to lift heavy weights, making it ideal for gaining muscle and strength. It is also less fatiguing than other deadlift variations, so you can do it more often without wearing yourself to a frazzle. 

 ( Fun fact : During a set of RDLs, your upper back has to work hard to prevent your shoulders rounding. This makes the RDL one of the best barbell trap exercises you can do, too. ) 

 How to : 

     Stand up straight holding a loaded barbell with a shoulder - width, overhand grip ( palms facing toward your body ). 
     Flatten your back and lower the weights toward the floor in a straight line while keeping your legs mostly straight, allowing your butt to move backward as you descend. 
     Once you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, bend your knees slightly more, and continue lowering the weights until your lower back begins to round — just below the knees for most people, and about mid - shin for those who are particularly flexible. 
     Reverse the movement and return to the starting position. 

 The Best Barbell Arm Exercises 
 1. Barbell Curl 

 Barbell Curl 

 The barbell curl is the most effective barbell bicep exercise because it allows you to use maximally heavy weights, which is beneficial for gaining strength and muscle. 

 How to : 

     While standing up straight, hold a barbell with your palms shoulder - width apart and facing away from you. 
     Your arms should be straight and the bar should be resting against your thighs. 
     Bring the bar up to shoulder height by bending at the elbow, and then lower it back to the starting position. 

 ( Tip : To make this exercise more challenging and effective, raise the bar up to eye level, allowing your upper arms to move forward, then lower it to the starting position ). 
 2. Close - Grip Barbell Bench Press 

 Close - Grip Barbell Bench Press 

 The close - grip bench press is most people is go - to barbell tricep exercise because it allows you to safely and effectively train all three heads of the triceps with heavy weights ( which can be difficult with other triceps exercises, like the skullcrusher ). 

 How to : 

     Lie on a flat bench, pull your shoulder blades together and down, and without lifting your butt or shoulders off the bench, slightly arch your back. 
     Grab the bar with a shoulder - width grip or slightly narrower and unrack the barbell so it is directly above your chest. 
     Bring the barbell to your lower chest while keeping your elbows tucked at about a 30 - degree angle relative to your torso. 
     When the bar touches your chest, explosively press the bar back to the starting position. 

 3. Lying Barbell Triceps Extension ( “ Skullcrusher ” ) 

 Skullcrusher 

 The lying barbell triceps extension ( aka the “ skullcrusher ” ) is a great barbell exercise for arms because it trains the slightly smaller medial and lateral heads of the triceps, ensuring you have defined, proportional upper arms. Although you could say this exercise involves an E - Z bar and not a regular barbell, an E - Z bar is simply a slightly lighter barbell with a slanted grip. 

 How to : 

     While lying on a flat bench, hold a barbell above your chest with a shoulder - width grip. 
     Bend your elbows and lower the bar until it is right above your forehead, and then reverse the movement to return to the starting position. 

 ( Tip : If you want to increase the range of motion of this exercise, lower the bar behind your head until it is almost touching the bench. ) 
 The Best Barbell Ab Exercises 
 1. Barbell Landmine Rainbow 

 Barbell Landmine Rainbow 

 The barbell landmine rainbow is a great barbell core exercise because it forces you to stabilize your core muscles under load, which builds the type of core strength and stability you need if you play sports that require you to twist and turn at speed. 

 How to : 

     Place one end of an empty barbell in a landmine attachment or wedge it into the corner of the room and load the other end with weight plates. 
     While facing the weighted end of the barbell, use both hands to hoist the barbell up to chest height. 
     Press the bar overhead, then keeping your arms straight, lower the bar down toward your left hip, pivoting your right foot inward as you lower the bar. 
     Using your core, drive the bar in an arch until it is back overhead, then lower it down toward your right hip, pivoting your left foot inward as you lower the bar. 
     Continue to alternate from side to side for the desired number of reps. 

 2. Barbell Rollout 

 Barbell Rollout 

 Studies show that the barbell rollout is an extremely effective exercise for training all parts of the abs and core, especially the rectus abdominis and the obliques. 

 How to : 

     Kneel down on the floor with a loaded barbell in front of you. 
     With your arms fully extended, grab the barbell and slowly roll it away from you. 
     Brace your core tightly so that your torso remains rigid and your lower back flat. 
     Roll the barbell until your body is as close to parallel with the floor as possible then roll yourself back to the starting position by flexing your abs. 

 Tip : start with your knees and feet in contact with the floor, but as you get stronger you can cross your feet and lift them off the floor a few inches to make the exercise more difficult. 

 3. Barbell Sit - up 

 Barbell Sit - up 

 The biggest benefit of the barbell sit - up is it is easy to add weight to. Being able to add weight to “ sit - up ” exercises increases their effectiveness and allows you to take advantage of progressive overload ( which is the most important driver of muscle growth ). 

 How to : 

     Lie on a sit - up bench with your feet wedged under the foot pads. 
     Using both hands, hold a barbell directly above your chest with your arms straight. 
     Keeping your arms perpendicular to the floor and your back flat, use your ab muscles to lift your chest toward the ceiling until your lower back comes completely off the bench. 
     Reverse the movement and return to the starting position.

  bar exercises 
 What Is A Barbell? 

 We first need to clarify what a barbell is. Barbells are comprised of a long, solid piece of metal with two thicker pieces on the end known as collars to load the barbell. 

 Over the years, barbells have evolved in size and function. Today, there are a few common styles, including Olympic barbells, squat barbells, and power barbells. 

 Generally speaking, the Olympic barbell is the most common style in a typical gym. These come in two sizes : 

     Men is Olympic Barbell : 7.2 Feet Long and 44 pounds with a 1.1 - inch diameter 
     Women is Olympic Barbell : 6.5 ft Long and 33 pounds with a 0.98 - inch diameter 

 Benefits Of Barbell Exercises 

 There is a reason barbell training is the primary method for anyone serious about building strength and gaining muscle mass. You need to include more barbell exercises in your training program, and here is why. 
 1. Barbells Are Highly Versatile : 

 The barbell is simply a tool to create an artificial load. Being so, there are very few limitations on how you can use one to perform an exercise. 

 This means that you can train the entire body with just a barbell. Every muscle group can be hit with this one piece of equipment, and all of the best compound exercises can incorporate a barbell. 

 Therefore, you need just a barbell paired with chin - ups to train the entire body. 
 2. Barbell Training Is Cost Effective : 

 Due to barbells being so versatile, they are easily the most cost - effective means if you want to train at home. The only other pieces of equipment you would need to buy are : 

     Weight plates for loading 
     A squat rack or power rack 
     Weight bench 

 You can buy all that for the price of one machine that only trains one movement pattern. 
 3. You Use More Muscle Mass : 

 The majority of barbell exercises consist of multi - joint movements, as that is what they are designed to do. In other words, they 're designed to train multiple large muscle groups at once. 

 While machines allow compound movements, barbells do a better job of strengthening stabilizer muscle groups. These are muscles that support our primary muscles and provide balance. 
 4. Barbell Exercises Are More Functional : 

 Barbells are free weights that allow you to replicate the basic movement patterns one sees in real life, such as pushing, pulling, standing up, and kneeling. 

 Further, barbell training requires balance and higher activation in the stabilizer muscles because the barbell is a free weight. This more realistically mimics real life. 
 5. Easy To Use Progressive Load : 

 Progressive overload is the key to building strength and muscle mass. Because barbells are loaded with plates and use a definite weight, it is easy to monitor your progress and apply heavier loads. 

 Advanced lifters can even get microplates, which are weight plates that weigh a fraction of a pound. These are essential to providing a minimal increase in weight. 
 6. Barbell Exercises Stimulate Higher Increase In Hormones : 

 Resistance training, in general, is going to improve your hormone levels. In fact, just being physically active will have a positive effect when compared to being sedentary. 

 That said, using heavy compound lifts is superior and creates a larger secretion of hormones. And recent research shows that when comparing barbell movements to a similar machine movement ( i.e., squat vs. leg press ), the barbell releases a greater amount¹. 
 7. You burn More Calories With Barbell Training : 

 We firmly believe that the primary purpose for weight lifting falls under a few categories : 

     Stimulating muscle growth or building strength 
     Maintaining muscle mass or strength 
     Improving performance variables such as power output 

 In other words, you do not choose an exercise for weight loss. Creating a caloric deficit, like through a cutting workout and diet plan, along with eating the best foods for muscles is your primary means of controlling your weight. 

 That said, weight training does burn calories, and because barbells allow heavy loads and use so much muscle mass, it burns more calories. Do not think of this as the reason to use barbell training ; rather, it is more like a sweet little bonus. 
 Main Muscle Groups 

 Your body has a lot of muscles, and each one is hit with barbell training. Because we cover a lot in this article, we will briefly review them with basic descriptions. However, we encourage you to take the time to learn anatomy more in - depth. 
 Chest : 

 The chest consists of several major muscles that can be hit with all types of equipment ranging from dumbbell exercises to cable chest exercises to the barbell moves we 're about to get into. 

 bar weight exercises 

     Pectoralis Major : The pectoralis major consists of the upper chest ( clavicular head ) and lower chest ( sternocostal head ). These are the primary movers for upper body pushing motions. 
     Pectoralis Minor : A smaller muscle that lays underneath the pectoralis major near the upper chest and connects the arm. 
     Intercostal : A group of several muscles that run between the ribs and allow respiration. 

 Back : 

 The back muscles are responsible for pulling, extending the spine, and providing structure to the torso, always working in unison. In other words, basically any compound back exercise is going to train every back muscle. 

 barbell lift 

 The major back muscles are : 

     Lats : This is the largest muscle of the upper body. The lats run down the spine and pull the shoulders down and back, like in the lat pull - down exercise. 
     Traps : The traps consist of three parts. In totality, the traps connect to the base of the skull and run down approximately 1/3 of the back. They then fan out to the shoulders. These 4 points give them an appearance of a trapezoid hence their name. 
     Rhomboids : Comprised of two muscles, rhomboid major and rhomboid minor, they are responsible for retracting, elevating, and rotating the shoulder blades. The two muscles form a rhomboid shape on the upper - middle back. 
     Erector Spinae : The erector spinae begins near the end of the spine and runs up about 2/3 of the way. As it travels up, it branches off into three " fingers " on each side. 

 Shoulders : 

 The shoulder muscles, also known as the deltoids, consist of three muscle heads. Together, these three muscles fully manipulate the arms. Different shoulder exercises target separate parts of the shoulder, but a few stand - out moves, like the overhead press, hit all the muscle heads at once. 

 best barbell exercises 

 The shoulder muscles include : 

     Anterior Deltoid ( front shoulder muscles ) 
     Lateral Deltoid ( middle shoulder muscles on the outside of the shoulder ) 
     Posterior Deltoid ( rear shoulder muscles ) 

 Arms : 

 The arms consist of two sections : the upper arms and lower arms. 

 bar lift exercise 

 Together, there are basically three different muscle groupings : 

     Biceps : These upper arm muscles flex the elbow and manipulate the forearm. 
     Triceps : These upper arm muscles are responsible for extending the elbow. 
     Forearm Muscles : They manipulate the hand and are responsible for grip strength. 

 Glutes : 

 ﻿The glutes are a set of three muscles that sit on the buttocks. Together, these muscles are the strongest in the human body and are primarily responsible for hip extension. They also play a role in virtually every movement the human body makes. And as a bonus, they can also make your jeans look phenomenal, which is probably why butt - lifting exercises are so popular. 

 bar lift workout 

     Gluteus Maximus : The largest and strongest of the 3 muscles, it acts as the primary hip extensor. 
     Gluteus Medius : The gluteus medius sits on the outside of the leg and is responsible for hip abduction. Further, it plays a large role in balance, especially on one leg. 
     Gluteus Minimus : The gluteus minimus sits under the gluteus minimus and has virtually the same roles. 

 Hamstrings : 

 The hamstrings sit on the posterior of the upper leg and consist of 3 muscles. Together, they are the primary knee flexors and play a role in hip extension. You will see one or both of these movements in the best hamstring exercises. 

 barbell strength training 

     Semitendinosus 
     Semimembranosus 
     Biceps Femoris 

 Quadriceps : 

 The quadriceps contain four muscles that sit on the front of the upper thigh. Together, these muscles work together in quad exercises and in daily life as the primary knee extender. 

 bench press bar exercises 

 They include : 

     Rectus Femoris 
     Vastus Lateralis 
     Vastus Intermedius 
     Vastus Medialis 

 The rectus femoris is the only quadricep muscle involved in hip flexion. 

 The Best Barbell Movements 

 When we look at the human body, there are several primary movements that we want to try to replicate, making pulling exercises, pushing workouts, squatting, lunging, and hinging crucial for any routine. 
 Vertical Pulling : 

 We 're starting with the only movement impossible to replicate with a barbell, and that is vertical pulling. Vertical pulling refers to exercises in which the arms grab an object from overhead and pull it toward the body. 
 Horizontal Pulling : 

 Horizontal pulling is when you pull an object toward your body. All of the back muscles and biceps are involved in horizontal pulling. 
 Vertical Pushing : 

 Vertical pushing occurs when you have an object overhead such as in the overhead press when you press the barbell overhead. The muscle trained are the shoulders, chest, and triceps. 
 Horizontal Pushing : 

 Horizontal pushing occurs when you push an object away from the body, such as in the bench press. The muscle trained are the chest, shoulders, and triceps. 
 Squat : 

 Many people confuse squats and hip - hinges. The main distinguishing factor is movement and flexion of the knee. When the knee comes forward and involves more knee extension ( quadriceps activation ), it is a squat. 
 Hip - Hinge : 

 Compared to the squat, in a true hip - hinge, the knee stays stationary and the shin vertical. The primary joint is the hips, with the posterior muscles being the primary movers. 

 The main muscles worked are the glutes and hamstrings. However, the erector spinae often plays a role in many hip - hinge movements. 
 Lunge : 

 A lunge is a movement in which a person takes a step forward with one foot and then lowers the body. Lunge exercises train every muscle in the lower body as well as improve balance. 

 There are also several types of lunges, such as the reverse lunge, which will hit the muscles differently. 
 The Best Barbell Exercises For Upper and Lower Body Training 

 We will break down the best barbell exercises into the upper and lower body to keep things organized. 
 Top Upper Body Barbell Exercises 

 First on the list are the best barbell exercises for the upper body. These barbell exercises will train the muscles that make up the chest, shoulders, back, and arms. 
 1. Overhead Press : 

 straight bar workouts 

 The standing barbell overhead press is probably the most underused barbell movement on this list, likely due to its difficulty. It involves pressing a loaded barbell straight overhead from the chest, and locking out the arms. 

 A cool fact about the overhead press is that it was actually an original movement in Olympic weightlifting. It was eventually taken out due to difficulty keeping standards for correct form ( athletes began bending the back to extremes ), but its legacy remains. 

 The overhead press might be the most challenging barbell exercise there is, but it will cause your upper body strength to blow up. Worth it ! 

 How to do the Overhead Press : 

     Set up an empty barbell on a rack. The bar should be placed lower than shoulder height around the middle pecs. You do not want to get on your tippy toes, so if you have to choose, set the bar so it is near your lower pec muscles rather than your upper chest. 
     Place your hands shoulder - width apart using an overhand grip. Get under the barbell with your elbows pushed in front of the barbell. 
     Your thumbs should be touching the outside of the shoulder with the barbell resting on the clavicle and deltoids. Extend your legs, unrack the barbell, and take 2 steps back. 
     At this point, be sure the barbell is resting on your body. Many new lifters will hold the barbell off the chest, which eats up energy. 
     Tighten the core muscles and glutes to create a firm base. When ready, drive the straight barbell overhead. 
     As the bar reaches the head, tuck it back until the bar passes and then pop it back in place. This allows the barbell to travel in a straight line. 
     Finish driving the bar straight above the head until your elbows are extended with the weight overhead. 

 2. Barbell Bench Press : 

 barbell bench exercises 

 Let is get into the horizontal press now. Perhaps the most popular barbell exercise, the barbell bench press is also one of the most misunderstood. 

 It is an amazing movement to improve the pushing strength and the upper body is overall musculature. However, it is not necessarily the greatest chest movement as many make it out to be. 

 The flat barbell bench press does train the chest, but it is actually more effective in increasing the size and strength of the triceps. Still, it remains one of the best barbell exercises because it is fundamental in providing a solid base to work from. You can also adjust your hand position, changing your barbell bench press grip to target different upper body muscles during the exercise. 

 We will also include several variations after our how - to, along with any modifications you need to make. 

 How to do the Barbell Bench Press : 

     Set up a bench and load the barbell. Lay down on the bench with your eyes directly beneath the barbell. 
     Grab the barbell wider slightly than shoulder - width apart. The barbell should sit in the crease of the thumb. To do this, reach your hand around the barbell. This will help keep your wrist straight during the movement. 
     Before unracking the barbell, dig your shoulder blades into the mat. Next, tuck your feet back. This does not need to be extreme, but you should have minimal tuck. This position causes your body to become much more stable and solid. 
     Unrack the barbell and bring it forward, so your arms are straight. This places it above your upper chest. Slowly lower the barbell down toward your lower chest. This means the barbell bench press is one of the few exercises in which the barbell does not travel straight. 
     As the barbell lowers, keep your elbows tucked at a 45 - degree angle. Let the barbell touch your chest and then drive it back up. 
     As you drive the barbell up, it makes a " J " as it travels up and back. 

 Incline Barbell Bench Press Variation : 

 Most will put the bench at 45 - degree angle. However, play around with smaller angles as well. The only difference is the barbell will come down higher on your chest, and the incline will hit the upper chest more. 
 Decline Bench Press Variation : 

 Again, experiment with various angles but the max should be 45 - degrees. The barbell will come down on your lower chest, and the decline will target the lower chest to a higher degree. 
 Close Grip Bench Press Variation : 

 For the close grip bench press, grab the barbell slightly narrower than shoulder width apart. As the barbell comes down, be sure to tuck your elbows. This creates greater flexion of the elbow while lessening the activity of the chest. 
 Wide Grip Bench Press Variation : 

 Place your hands wider than a traditional grip. This will cause less flexion in the elbow and greater activation in the chest. 
 3. Barbell Bent Over Row : 

 exercises with barbell weights 

 Let is hit those back muscles now, shall we? The barbell bent over row should be your primary exercise for building your back muscles. It is really that simple. 

 This single movement is going to hit every single muscle in your entire back. If that is not enough, the bent - over row does a lot more, including training your biceps, particularly with an underhand grip, requires an intense isometric contraction in your posterior chain ( erector spinae, glutes, hamstrings ), and needs total core activation to support being bent over. 

 There are several barbell bent over row grips, and utilizing all of them will help you target each of the major back muscles differently. 

 Pay attention to the starting position for the bent - over row. It tends to be very difficult for some people, so take your time when first training. 

 How to do the Barbell Bent Over Row : 

     Load a barbell on the ground and stand in the middle with a comfortable stance. Your feet should be somewhere between shoulder width apart and hip width stance. 
     Bend down and use and grab the barbell with hands slightly wider than shoulder - width apart and an overhand grip. This prep portion should look similar to a deadlift. Stand up erect. 
     Now time for the starting position. Push the hips back slightly and lean your torso forward while bending your knees slightly. Pull your shoulder blades back to maintain a straight, ridged back. 
     Keep coming down while keeping a slight bend in your knee. You must drop the torso forward enough that the arms hang freely in front of your knees. 
     Try to get your torso as parallel to the ground as possible. The more parallel you get, the more emphasis you place on the back. When ready, brace and pull the barbell up to the belly. 
     As you pull, have your elbows bent at a 45 - degree angle. Think about pulling your elbows to the ceiling rather than pulling the barbell up. This will encourage proper form and maximal use of the back muscles. 
     Pull all the way up and then slowly lower the barbell. 

 Variation : 

 Use an underhand grip shoulder width apart, which is more narrow than the traditional grip. Your arms should slide against your body straight back, creating greater flexion in the elbows ( greater bicep activation ) and increasing your range of motion. 
 Top Lower Body Barbell Exercises 

 Now, it is time for the lower half. When using a barbell to train the lower body, you will hit every muscle in every movement. However, we still have more than one exercise due to how different movements activate the muscles differently. 
 1. Barbell Back Squat : 

 types of barbell lifts 

 The barbell back squat is the king of lower body exercise. It trains the entire lower body while placing huge stress on the core ( in a good way ). The barbell back squat is the best exercise to create strength in the lower body. 

 Often seen as a competition with the deadlift, these two are separate, but equally awesome, exercises. That said, we rank it as the No. 1 lower body exercise simply because of the much larger range of motion seen in the knees and hips. 

 Further, the back squat also requires significantly more mobility in your lower body joints. 

 How to do the Barbell Back Squat : 

     Set up a barbell on either a squat rack or power rack slightly lower than shoulder height. Again, you do not want to have to get on your tippy toes to unrack the barbell. 
     Place hands wider than shoulder - width apart with an overhand grip. Get under the barbell and place it on the upper portion of your back at shoulder level. It should lay across your traps. 
     Unrack the barbell and take two steps back. Brace your core and push your hips back to begin the movement. 
     As you lower, aim to have the bar drop straight down. Maintain a tight core and straight back the whole time. 
     Continue dropping your hips back but allow your knees to travel forward, ensuring they always track over your toes. Continue until the top of your thigh breaks parallel, and drive back up by pushing your feet down. 

 2. Barbell Deadlift : 

 bar bench workout 

 If the barbell back squat is the king of lower body exercises, that would mean the deadlift is the king of all exercises. While there is definitely room for debate on this, the deadlift is arguably the best of the best barbell exercises. Implementing the deadlift into your regular program will greatly strengthen and develop a ton of your major muscle groups. 

 Generally listed as a lower body exercise, the deadlift really stresses the entire body, primarily the lower body and back. 

 How to do the Barbell Deadlift : 

     Load a barbell on the ground. Stand next to the barbell with your feet shoulder - width apart. Most people stand too wide so pay attention to this. 
     The barbell should be over your midfoot and an inch or so away from your shin. Push your hips back to lower your body. 
     As you lower, your shins will come forward slightly and make contact with the barbell. However, they should be relatively vertical. 
     Continue dropping your body so your shoulders drop straight down until you can grab the barbell. Grab the barbell, so your hands are just outside your legs. 
     Pull your shoulder blades back and push your chest forward. Your back should be tight and straight. Be sure to have your feet flat on the ground with your weight spread evenly across your feet. 
     Your arms should parallel your shins and all your joints " tight. " This is the starting position. When ready, brace your core and drive your feet down to the ground to pull the bar straight up your legs to the knee. At this point, your back should be at the same angle. 
     Once the barbell passes your knees, you begin to drive your hips forward until your body is erect. 
     Slowly lower the weight going down. Using a big weight, you can do a controlled drop. You let the bar drop but give some guidance and resistance. This is to minimize bounce or the bar getting away. There are very few situations in which dropping the bar is acceptable. 

 Snatch Grip Deadlift Variation : 

 An effective and easy variation is widening your bar grip and using a snatch grip. This is roughly 1.5 times your normal grip. It does not need to be exact, so an easy method is to place your index or middle finger on the outermost ring. From here, everything else remains the same. 
 3. Barbell Hip Thrust : 

 barbell rod exercises 

 Interestingly, the barbell hip thrust is the only single joint exercise on this list. However, that joint is the hip and utilizes the strongest muscles in the human body, the glutes. 

 This means the load can be placed directly on the joint in the hip crease providing a direct force. In fact, this is the only exercise that does this. That said, it is basically universally agreed that it is the best glute exercise. 

 How to do the Barbell Hip Thrust : 

     Set up a steady bench. Sit in front with your knees bent and upper back digging in the bench. 
     Place a barbell in your hip crease and place your hands on the barbell for balance. 
     When ready, drive your heels into the ground and drive your hips up. Continue until your torso is 100 % extended. Slowly lower and repeat. 

 4. Barbell Forward Lunge : 

  full body barbell workout 

 The barbell lunge will switch things up a bit as it is the only unilateral exercise on this list. While both legs are involved, the primary muscles activated only occur in one leg. 

   than giving you the ability to identify muscular imbalances, the lunge is perfect for improving balance and moving a weight under motion. 

 How to do the Barbell Forward Lunge : 

     Place a barbell on your back or front, similarly to either the front squat or back squat, depending on your preference. Hold the barbell at least wider than shoulder - width apart to help balance. 
     Stand with a neutral stance. Take one big step forward. You may need to play around to get the right distance. 
     Keeping your toes straight, lower your body straight down. 
     As you lower to the ground, your knees should begin to form a 90 - degree angle, and the front shin and rear thigh should be vertical as the rear knee hits the floor. 
     Push off the forward leg, returning it back to standing. Repeat on the opposite side. 

 5. Barbell Front Squat : 

 long bar exercises 

 Do not be confused. When it comes to front squats vs. back squats, both may be barbell squats but are rather different in biomechanics and muscle activation. 

 The front squat gets its name as the barbell is placed on the front of the body rather than on the back ( which makes sense ). Even though this may only mean the bar placement differs by a few inches, those inches cross the body is center of gravity. 

 As a result, the body is biomechanics are drastically altered as the body lowers to keep the bar over the ankle straight. For this to occur, the torso remains much more vertical with less hip flexion. 

 This should create higher activation in the quadriceps but the data actually is not that clear. However, one major benefit is there is less force on the spine². Plus, there is also serious activation of the core muscles and upper back to prevent it from flopping over. In fact, studies even show it generates more muscle activity in the shoulder muscles compared to an overhead squat³ ! 

 How to do the Barbell Front Squat : 

     Rack a barbell so that it sits at about mid - chest level. Walk up to the barbell and bend down to get under it. 
     Lift your arms out straight in front of you. This will cause your anterior deltoid to cause a lump. The barbell will sit behind this lump. Flex your elbows and reach back to balance the barbell with your hands. 
     Stand up, keeping your elbows pointing out straight. This is called the front rack position. Step back with feet flat and hip - width apart. 
     Push your hips back to squat. Your torso will remain upright during the front squat to keep the barbell over your feet. Continue dropping until the top of your thigh hits parallel. Power back up. 
     As you rise, focus on driving your elbows up. This will help maintain an erect torso. 

 6. Barbell Romanian Deadlift : 

  barbell uses 

 The last lower body exercise is the Romanian deadlift. This hip hinge movement has a similar movement pattern as the deadlift and uses the same muscles. There are a few major differences, however, including that the starting position begins with standing, the hips have greater flexion, and the knees are slightly bent. And finally, the loaded barbell never touches the ground. 

 As a result, the Romanian deadlift is a much more effective exercise to hit the posterior chain. 

 How to do the Barbell Romanian Deadlift : 

     Load a barbell and stand with feet shoulder - width apart. Lower down and grab the bar with an overhand shoulder - width grip or slightly wider. 
     Stand up with a form similar to a deadlift. This is the starting position. 
     Take a deep breath, and push your hips back, keeping a minimal bend in the knees. Pull your shoulder blades back to maintain an erect and ridged back. 
     Start to slowly lower the barbell in a straight line down your body. It does not need to touch your body but should remain close. As you lower, think about building tension in the glutes and hamstring. 
     Continue lowering but keep the knees slightly bent. The goal is not to reach the ground but to build tension in the posterior chain. Lower until you at least pass the knees slightly. From here, continue but once your form begins to break, stop. The easiest sign is your back will begin to round, and your shoulder blades will come forward. Once this starts to happen, stop. 
     Begin coming back up but concentrate on driving your hips forward. We like to do the concentric portion explosively. 
     Push your hips forward until you 're erect back in the starting position. 

 Variation : 

 You can also use the snatch grip with the Romanian deadlift. 
 Power Barbell Exercises 

 Every athlete needs some power in their training. Here are two of our favorites. 
 1. Power Clean And Jerk : 

 barbell bench press lie 

 The clean and jerk is an amazing power exercise, combining two movements into one of the most challenging barbell exercises. While it can take some time to learn, it would benefit any athlete who puts in the time and wants to improve their strength and lean body mass. The power clean is easier to perform compared to a full clean as you do not need to drop into a squat. 

 How to do the Power Clean and Jerk : 

     Set up similar to a deadlift but use a grip slightly wider than shoulder width. Push your chest up farther so it is more vertical. 
     You may need to sink your hips more. Begin the movement by driving your feet into the ground and driving up. 
     Your back will remain at the same angle until the barbell passes the knees. At this point, perform triple extension and forcefully push your hips forwards to extend your joints. 
     Immediately perform a power shrug by shrugging and allowing the barbell to travel up your body. Be sure to bring your elbows up high. 
     As the bar travels up, drop into a 1/4 squat and pull your body under the bar. Flip your elbows up and catch the barbell in the front rack position. Fully extend your knees. 
     Now, drop slightly ( no more than 1/4 squat ) and then forcefully extend your hips to drive the barbell up. Use your arms to help drive the bar completely overhead as you split your legs so one is in front of the other. 
     Make sure the front leg is fully extended, while the back leg is flexed slightly. Fully straighten your arms, fully locking the bar overhead. 

 2. Snatch Grip High Pull : 

 power barbell exercise 

 The snatch grip high pulls a highly effective power movement. Also, it will build a crazy strong upper back. 

 We like it because it is much simpler to perform than other Olympic movements. At the end of the day, it is a clean without actually catching the bar. 

 How to do the Snatch Grip High Pull : 

     Grab the barbell in a similar manner to the snatch grip deadlift. You can move the grip slightly narrower if needed. 
     One difference is you want to try to get your chest up higher, so you may need to sink your hips lower. Begin driving up by driving your feet into the ground. Your upper body will remain the same until the barbell hits your knees. 
     At this point, you will forcefully implement triple extension driving your hips forward. As soon as you hit extension, you are performing a power shrug and pulling the barbell high. Be sure to keep your elbows elevated high. 
     Instead of catching the barbell, you will simply let it fall to the ground using a controlled drop. 

 The Best Barbell Core Exercise 

 You probably were not expecting to see a core exercise on here, but - surprise ! Most barbell exercises people speak about are those performed for the upper and lower body. However, this single barbell exercise is likely the only core exercise you will need to do. 

 That is why there is only one. 
 1. The Barbell Rollout : 

 power barbell workout 

 Who needs dumbbell ab exercises when you have the barbell rollout? The barbell rollout is a rollout done on a barbell rather than one of those little plastic toys. While those would work, using the barbell has two unique advantages : 1 ) You can add weight plates to load the barbell and increase the intensity, and 2 ) The barbell allows wider hand placement for those who lack shoulder mobility. 

 How to do the Barbell Rollout : 

     Load a barbell and place it on the ground. Kneel behind it and place your hands wider than shoulder - width apart using an overhand grip. If your shoulder joints have poor mobility, use a wider grip. 
     Get your entire body over the barbell with your arms straight. Keep your core tight and begin to let the barbell roll out in front of you. 
     As you lower, begin to push the barbell out in front of the body. Continue moving down until your body is erect. You should be very close to the ground. 
     Using your core, pull yourself back up. 

 Barbell Rollout Tips : 

 A few things to keep in mind : You can not perform this with an empty barbell. You can only use full - sized plates with a metal ring. And, eventually, you want to progress to doing them standing. 
 Barbell Training Tips 

 The above barbell exercises are all you need to get an awesome workout in, especially when you manipulate your training variables, switching up things like hand grips. Below are some workout tips to help you make the most of your barbell training, whether you 're focusing on barbell leg exercises or barbell back exercises. 
 1. Include Both Strength And Hypertrophy : 

 The general public often tries to combine strength and hypertrophy, but they 're two different physiological adaptations. 

 When discussing strength training vs. hypertrophy, strength training refers to improving the intramuscular system and making the existing muscles function better together. As a result, you become stronger. This is best done with loads of 85 - 95 % 1RM and reps of 5 - 1. For average lifters, 85 % is generally heavy enough. 

 Hypertrophy training refers to the actual muscle getting larger. This may or may not include strength gains. The primary driver for muscle hypertrophy is volume and is best done with loads of 70 - 80 % 1RM ( or less ) with loads of 8 - 12, or more. 







 

 The best exercises for your health – and how to start working out 

 12 min read 

  

 Most of us know that exercise is good for our health. But if you ’re new to physical activity or you ’re picking it up again after a period away, the idea of exercising can be intimidating. 

 Experts believe that the best exercise for your health is the kind that you will do regularly. And studies have shown that enjoyment is a major factor in sticking with any type of physical activity. When you discover ways of moving your body that bring you joy, physical activity becomes a treat, rather than a chore. 

 Exercise is something that almost everyone can do. Its benefits can be felt right away, and you do not have to train for anything major to reap the rewards – small, consistent sweat sessions are enough to stay healthy. 

 Below, we will explore the best exercises for your health and how you can start working out. 
 First of all, how much exercise do you need? 

 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), adults should aim for 150 minutes of moderate - intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous - intensity every week. 

 During moderate - intensity aerobic activity, you should feel out of breath, but still be able to hold a conversation. Dancing, treading water, canoeing and yoga are great examples of moderate - intensity aerobic activities. 

 In vigorous - intensity aerobic activity, you will be too winded to speak more than a few words at a time. Jogging at a fast pace, biking uphill, jumping rope and cross - country skiing are great examples of vigorous - intensity aerobic activities. 

 The CDC also recommends that adults include activities that strengthen muscles, like weightlifting, on two or more days of the week. 

 While all this may seem like a lot, how you spread your exercise time throughout the week is up to you. You could work out for 30 minutes five times a week, fit in hour - long workouts three times a week, or do fast - paced HIIT ( high - intensity interval training ) workouts for 15 minutes five times a week. You can decide what works best for you. 
 What are the types of exercise? 

 If you ’re new to exercising, you may want to try several different kinds of physical activity to discover what you like. Remember, do not only focus on what kind of movement you can do, but also ask yourself what kind of movement you enjoy doing. When you enjoy an activity, you ’re more likely to keep doing it. 

 And you can like more than one type of exercise. In fact, it is better to vary your exercise routine with more than one kind of physical activity so you can work different muscle groups in different ways.

 Cardio 

 Cardio, also called aerobic exercise, is any form of movement that gets your heart rate up, your blood pumping and your lungs working. It activates and strengthens your cardiovascular system, but also improves the health of your whole body and mind. Cardio can lower stress, improve sleep and flood your brain with those feel - good endorphins. It is also an excellent tool when it comes to weight loss. 

 Cardio can be the most easily accessible form of exercise – and the simplest. A brisk walk or yard work can count as cardio, as long as you start to get hot, sweaty and out of breath. While the classic image of cardio is someone huffing and puffing on a jog, there are so many activities to choose from when it comes to cardio : 

     Walking and hiking : Walking is one of the best cardio exercises out there because it can be done almost anywhere and with little equipment. All you need is a pair of comfortable, sturdy shoes. If you ’re just starting out, walk 5 - 10 minutes per day and work your way up to 30 minutes or more per day. Regular walking can help you lose weight, prevent disease, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve your mood. Hiking allows you to explore and enjoy nature, and often burns more calories than walking by involving steeper, more uneven paths. Plus, research shows just being outside can offer a range of health benefits. 
     Running : Like walking, you just need a pair of well - fitting shoes to start running. No matter where you run or how fast you go, regular runs can improve your cardiovascular health, your bones and muscles, and your mental health. 
     Dancing : For a fun, exciting workout, try dancing. While dance can bring the same cardiovascular benefits as other forms of cardio, it can also help increase flexibility as you move your body in new ways. And the social aspects of dancing, not to mention learning the choreography, strengthen our cognitive function. 
     Cycling : Cycling is a great way to target and strengthen your lower body while working your heart and lungs. And the task of staying upright on a bicycle, stationary or not, helps your balance and posture. Riding a bike is also a great alternative to one of our most popular sedentary activities : driving. The next time you have somewhere to go – the grocery store, a friend is house, the post office – try riding your bike instead. 
     Swimming : When you swim, you get all the cardiovascular benefits of aerobic exercise, with none of the impact. Working out in the water gives your joints a break while still strengthening muscles throughout your body. And you can burn calories without all the sweat. 
     Jumping rope : Nothing gets the heart pumping like jumping rope. It is an incredibly efficient cardiovascular workout that you can squeeze into any busy schedule. You can get all the heart healthy benefits you need from just 10 - 15 minutes of jumping rope. And it is fun ! 

 Strength training 

 Strength training is a great way to build muscle and lose fat. This type of exercise involves subjecting your muscles to some form of resistance through lifting and moving heavy objects or straining against gravity. There are so many forms of strength training based on equipment and how much weight you are lifting. 

     Body weight exercises : When you ’re getting started with strength training, exercises that use only your body weight are usually enough for you to start getting stronger. Pushups, planks, squats, lunges and burpees are all great options. Doing these exercises without additional weight also allows you to practice and perfect proper form, which is essential for preventing injuries in the future. 
     Weight machines : Using weight machines allows for more opportunities to practice your weightlifting form before you lift unassisted. Machines can also help you target specific muscles and give you a more controlled range of motion. 
     Free weights : Lifting weights is considered a functional exercise, meaning it can make you better at daily tasks like climbing the stairs, carrying grocery bags and cleaning around the house. It trains entire muscle groups to improve strength, balance and coordination. 

 A comprehensive strength training routine can include a combination of all three types of weight - related exercise. 
 Stretching 

 Stretching increases and maintains your flexibility, or your body is ability to move in different ways without injury. Stretching regularly can help you perform better physically, use your full range of motion and avoid injuries. The best time to stretch is after a workout, when your muscles are warmed up from movement, but you can still benefit from stretching at any time. 

     Static stretching : This kind of stretch is achieved through lengthening your muscles as far as they will go without pain, and then holding that position for 15 - 30 seconds. There are two types of static stretching, active and passive. In active stretching, you contract one muscle to allow the opposite muscle to relax. Lying on your back and lifting your leg straight up into the air makes your thigh muscle contract, while your hamstring can lengthen and stretch. In passive stretching, you use an external force, like your hand, to help your body stretch. When you bend your knee and use your hand to hold your foot behind you to stretch your thigh muscle, that is a passive stretch. 
     Dynamic stretching : Before a workout, try dynamic stretching to get your muscles warmed up and ready for activity. Dynamic stretching is more active than just touching your toes. Movements include toe touches, high knees, butt kicks and lateral shuffles. 

 If you experience pain when stretching, talk to your doctor or a physical therapist. They can suggest stretches that will not hurt and will help you increase flexibility slowly. 
 Balance exercises 

 Keeping your balance is an essential skill in multiple sports and daily activities, and it only gets more important as you get older. Working on your balance now can help you prevent falls later in life and avoid the injuries that often come with them. 

     Yoga : Better sleep, better mood, better flexibility – yoga has a lot of benefits. A huge part of any yoga practice is balance. Yoga challenges your body to maintain balance as it flows through dynamic poses and maintains different positions. In doing so, you release tight muscles and strengthen those essential stabilizer muscles, both of which lower your risk of falling. 
     Tai chi : A low - impact exercise that can be done almost anywhere, tai chi is an excellent way to control stress and improve balance. The flowing movements from one pose to the next allow you to practice shifting your weight from one foot to another with your arms outstretched. 

 What exercise is best? 

 Finding the exercise that works best for you and your lifestyle can seem overwhelming, but you do not need to stick to just one. Everybody needs a few different types of workouts to get all the mind and body benefits of exercise. Engaging in different workouts also keeps exercise exciting and helps you continue challenging your body to grow stronger, avoiding a fitness plateau. 

 How you spend your exercise time depends on your goals and what you ’re trying to achieve. 
 Exercising for your age 

 Everyone, whether 8 years old or 80, benefits from regular exercise. And it is never too late to start. If exercise has not been a part of your life up to this point, it is still possible to get fit no matter how old you are – and there are tremendous advantages to doing so. 

 As you age, exercise allows you to stay limber and active while also reducing your risk of injury. You can maintain the energy to continue doing the things you love – like exploring new cities by foot, playing with your grandchildren and walking your dog. 

 This is when exercising for balance becomes especially important, so you can avoid falls and prevent injury. Cardio should still be included for a well - rounded exercise routine, but target heart rate – how fast your heart can safely beat during a workout to prevent injury and get the most benefit – decreases as we age. You can opt for lighter cardio in the later stages of life. 

 The CDC recommends that children and teens ( ages 6 - 17 ) exercise for at least one hour every day. Children of any age exercise through play, but as they get older, they made need more structure and encouragement to get moving. To help kids get the exercise they need to be healthy, try the following tips : 

     Take them to parks, playgrounds and pools regularly 
     Sign them up for sports teams through their school or the local park district 
     Set a good example with your own commitment to physical activity 

 Adults also need play sometimes and running around with your kids helps you get a good workout in too. When children learn the importance of regular exercise early on, they can establish lifelong healthy habits around fitness. 
 Exercising for your life stage 

 Our circumstances and situations change throughout our lives, and our exercise needs change with them. Whether starting a new job, going through a pregnancy, caring for your kids or moving to a new neighborhood or city, you might not always have the same amount of time to exercise as you have had in the past. That is okay ! You should not put extra pressure on yourself to maintain an exercise routine that does not work for you anymore. 

 When life gets busy, one key thing to remember about exercise is this : it is not about how much exercise you do, but how often you do it. One study, done in 2016, demonstrated that 10 minutes of fast - paced aerobic exercise had the same cardio metabolic benefits as 50 minutes of steady, continuous aerobic exercise. 

 Fitting in 15 - 20 minutes of physical exertion each day, wherever you can, is enough to still get some benefits of fitness. Remember, exercise is just one part of our lives, it is not the center of them. 
 Exercising as part of recovery 

 Following an injury or medical diagnosis, you can use exercise to regain and maintain strength. However, it requires patience. Resuming all your regular activities too quickly can put you at risk of reinjuring yourself. So go slowly at first. And while exercise may be the last thing you want to do when you ’re in pain, regular workouts can actually help address any chronic pain you ’re feeling. 

 You can work with your primary care doctor or a physical therapist to develop a plan that helps you get back on track. They can make sure you do exercises that work the proper muscle groups, while also being safe for your condition. 
 Exercising at home 

 Working out in public can be intimidating, especially if you ’re just starting out. But you do not need a membership at a gym or a ton of fancy equipment to get or stay fit. Just an open spot in your house where you will not collide with or knock anything over, and a pair of comfortable shoes. You may also want a yoga mat to provide cushion if you have a hardwood floor. 

 You can start with small, easy movements, like marching in place and arm circles, and then ramp up the challenge as you get more comfortable. There are tons of apps and videos online to help you make the most of at - home workouts, or you can develop your own routine involving strength training exercises that use your body weight. Once you ’re working out at home regularly, consider investing in a set of free weights so you can keep building strength. 
 How to start exercising 

 Starting anything new can be tricky, but exercise may seem especially daunting. Start slow and go at your own pace. The journey is worth it. Exercising is one of the best things you can do for your physical and mental health – and to avoid chronic medical conditions. 
 Set SMART goals 

 It is easy to get lost in the vast world of fitness, to lose sight of why you started and quit. This is where goals come in. Setting goals for yourself can act as a roadmap to help you navigate what exercise means to you and how it fits into your life. Goals are a fantastic motivational tool, but only when used properly. When developing exercise goals, make them specific, measurable, attainable, reasonable and timely. These are called SMART goals. 

 You ’re more likely to achieve SMART goals than you are goals that are too big, too vague and too ambitious. For example, it is fine to have a goal of getting stronger, but how do you get there? Creating goals around slowly increasing the amount of weight you lift or the number of repetitions you do can help you find your way. And, setting short - term goals that you then achieve will help you feel a sense of reward that keeps your motivation high. 

 Maybe you want to shed a couple pounds to look and feel better. Exercising to lose weight can be a great goal, but it is easy to fall into harmful habits and patterns. Just remember that it takes time to lose weight, so be patient with yourself. 

 Sometimes doctors will recommend exercise to alleviate or improve the symptoms of certain conditions. The ill effects of high blood pressure, diabetes and arthritis can be improved and prevented through regular physical activity. 
 Find people to help you meet your exercise goals 

 One of the greatest resources you can use when you want to start exercising or exercising more often is other people. Whether they ’re a friend or a professional, people can help you get started and stay on track when it comes to your fitness journey. If you ’re looking for a little help, look to those around you : 

     Ask about personal training or fitness classes at your local health club. Whether you prefer working out one - on - one or in a group, sometimes we all need a little company. Many gyms offer classes in everything from water aerobics to dance, and it is a great way to find a fitness community. 
     Seek support from your friends and family. If you bring up exercise, you might be surprised at who wants to join you. Working out with someone is a great way to make sure exercise happens, even when you ’re feeling unmotivated. 
     Talk to your primary care doctor. If you have any medical conditions, your primary care doctor can recommend the types of exercise that make sense for you. 

 Slowly increase activity levels 

 It is never too late to start working out, but it can be confusing to know where to start. A good initial fitness goal is to decrease the amount of time you spend sitting down. Stand up every hour to stretch or walk around for 10 - 15 minutes. Then continue building activity into your routine. 

 In the beginning it can be as simple as slipping in exercise during routine activities. Instead of driving the five minutes to the store to pick up a few things, you might try walking. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. If it is nice outside, ride your bike to work. 

 If you ’re getting together with a friend for coffee, suggest that you get your beverages to go and then head off for a walk – even if you ’re just wandering around a mall. Or, when you ’re getting caught up on your shows after work, stand up and do some stretching. 

 Fitting in exercise around the things you already do will make it seem easier and less disruptive to your daily routine. You will be more motivated to continue increasing your activity time, and slowly exercise will become part of your daily routine as well. 
 Take care of yourself 

 Exercise is not just another chore to check off your to - do list, though sometimes it may feel that way. It is a lifelong investment. So, exercise has to be approached in such a way that you can keep it up for years to come. 

 If you throw yourself into too - frequent workouts, you may injure yourself or lose interest after a few months or years. If you do find yourself feeling ambivalent about the activity you once loved, do not panic. Take a break, and allow yourself to devote time to other areas of your life. You may regain your passion down the road. Or you can switch it up, and try different types of exercise for a while. 

 To make exercise a sustainable habit, try the following tips : 

     Stretch before and after exercising 
     Drink plenty of water – unless you ’re running marathons, you probably will not need a sports drink 
     If you find that you have pain that is caused by exercise, talk to your doctor. They will be able to provide suggestions to ease the pain ( so you can continue to get the big benefits of exercise ). Or they may refer you to a specialist such as a physical therapist who can help you work out better. 
     Keep up with preventive care, and you will be able to see the impact that changes in your lifestyle are having on your overall health. 

 Get in a groove 

 Momentum is a necessary part of exercise, both literally and metaphorically. While you need momentum to keep you moving, you also need momentum to keep hitting your goals. How do you build and maintain momentum? 

     Be consistent : One of the most important aspects of exercise is consistency. Running 10 miles every once in a while is not going to be nearly as beneficial to your fitness goals as running shorter distances 4 - 5 times a week. 
     Build routines : Schedule workouts in your calendar so they ’re harder to skip. 
     Notice improvement : Maybe you ’re able to run that extra mile this week, or you can lift the 15 - pound weight instead of the 12. Notice and celebrate each stride you make, and it will be a lot easier to keep coming back for more. 










 7 Best Exercises for Seniors ( and a Few to Avoid ! ) 
 7 best exercises for seniors ( and a few to avoid ! ) 

 Exercise and nutrition are essential parts of a healthy lifestyle throughout one is life, and as we age, our requirements are ever changing. A growing body of research illustrates how regular exercise is especially important for seniors, and how more seniors are opting for an active lifestyle instead of a sedentary one. This article will show you the benefits of exercise for older adults, the seven best forms of exercise for seniors, and a few exercises that may be hazardous to seniors ’ health. 
 The Health Benefits of Exercise in Older Adults 

 Our biology changes as we get older, causing seniors to have different reasons for staying in shape than younger generations. Though physical fitness provides benefits at any age, the health perks physically fit seniors enjoy are more notable. Physicians and researchers say seniors should remain as active as possible, without overexerting one is self. In older adults, exercise helps you live a longer, healthier, and more joyous life. 

 Some of the benefits of exercising later in life include : 
 More exercise means more independence for seniors : 

 Seniors that exercise regularly are less likely to depend on others. According to Harvard Medical School, regular exercise promotes an older adults ability to walk, bathe, cook, eat, dress, and use the restroom. If self - reliance is a priority, exercise is one of the best ways to maintain independence for older adults. 
 Exercise improves balance for older adults : 

 Falling down is a much bigger deal for older adults than younger ones. Every 11 seconds, an older adult is admitted to an emergency room for a fall - related injury, and every 19 minutes, a senior dies from a fall, according to the National Council of Aging. Though no two falls are alike, and preventing falls is very complex, regular exercise reduces the likelihood of falling by 23 %. 
 Regular exercise means more energy : 

 Though it seems counter - intuitive, being inactive makes you tired and being active gives you more energy. Any amount of exercise promotes the release of endorphins, which are essential neurotransmitters linked to pain mitigation and a sense of well - being. Endorphins combat stress hormones, promote healthy sleep, and make you feel more lively and energetic, overall. 
 Exercise helps prevent and counteract disease : 

 Heart disease, osteoporosis, depression and diabetes are common diseases among older adults, and are often deadly. Fortunately, adopting a more active lifestyle can contribute to the prevention of these diseases, or reduce the unpleasant symptoms of these diseases if you already have them. If you are at - risk for disease, exercise may be the key to warding off an unpleasant condition. 
 Regular exercise improves brain function : 

 One of the most remarkable developments in health science is the revelation that the mind and the body are much more closely linked. A healthy body likely means a healthy mind, and seniors that exercise on a regular basis have improved cognitive health. More recently, a study from the Alzheimer is Research & Prevention Foundation, regular exercise has been shown to reduce your risk of developing Alzheimer is disease or dementia by nearly 50 %. 
 The Best Exercises for Seniors 

 Exercise is crucial for older adults, but it can be hard to know where to begin. If you have not worked out for a while, re - entry into the active world can be daunting. There is also a good chance the exercises you were once accustomed to are not ideal for older adults. 

 Before you launch into an exercise regimen, it is important to check with a physician to ensure you ’re healthy enough for exercise, and to see which exercises are ideal for your current fitness level. 
 1. Water aerobics 

 7 best exercises for seniors ( and a few to avoid ! ) 

 In the past years, water aerobics have become an extremely popular form of exercise among all ages, but in particular to seniors. Exercising in the water is ideal for those living with arthritis and other forms of joint pain, as the buoyancy of the water puts less stress on your joints. Additionally, water brings natural resistance, which eliminates the need for weights in strength training. Water aerobics exercises improve your strength, flexibility, and balance with minimal stress on your body. 

 Great water aerobics exercises for seniors include : 

     Aqua jogging 
     Flutter kicking 
     Leg lifts 
     Standing water push - ups 
     Arm curls 

 2. Chair yoga 

 7 best exercises for seniors ( and a few to avoid ! ) 

 Like water aerobics, chair yoga is a low - impact form of exercise that improves muscle strength, mobility, balance and flexibility, all of which are crucial health aspects for seniors. Chair yoga is an accessible form of yoga that provides less stress on muscles, joints, and bones than more conventional forms of yoga. 

 As an added bonus, chair yoga has been shown to improve mental health in older adults. Regular chair yoga participants have better quality sleep, lower instances of depression, and report a general sense of well - being. 

 Great chair yoga exercises for seniors include : 

     Overhead stretch 
     Seated cow stretch 
     Seated cat stretch 
     Seated mountain pose 
     Seated twist 

 3. Resistance band workouts 

 7 best exercises for seniors ( and a few to avoid ! ) 

 Resistance bands are stretchy strips of rubber that add resistance to workouts with reduced stress on your body. Resistance band workouts are user - friendly, and accessible for beginners. This form of exercise is growing more popular among seniors because of the relatively cheap up - front costs of materials, which makes resistance band workouts ideal for at - home exercise. Additionally, these exercises are ideal for strengthening your core, which improves posture, mobility, and balance. 

 Resistance band workouts for seniors include : 

     Leg press 
     Triceps press 
     Lateral raise 
     Bicep curl 
     Band pull apart 

 4. Pilates 

 7 best exercises for seniors ( and a few to avoid ! ) 

 Pilates is a popular low - impact form of exercise that was developed a century ago. In pilates exercises, breathing, alignment, concentration and core strength are emphasized, and typically involves mats, pilates balls, and other inflated accessories to help build strength without the stress of higher - impact exercises. Pilates has been shown to improve balance, develop core strength and increase flexibility in older adults. 

 Some great pilates exercises for older adults include : 

     Mermaid movement 
     Side circles 
     Food slides 
     Step ups

 5. Walking 

 7 best exercises for seniors ( and a few to avoid ! ) 

 One of the least stressful and accessible forms of exercise is walking. For some seniors, walking is a bigger challenge than others, so distance and step goals differ from person to person. For the general population, 10,000 steps per day is advised for a healthy lifestyle, but those with difficulty walking or joint pain may settle for a smaller number as a goal. A  study found that walking 10,000 steps lowered the ten - year outlook for mortality by 46 %. Walking promotes a healthy lifestyle, while strengthening muscles, lowering your risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and colon cancer. 

 Ideas for walking exercises for seniors : 

     Find a moderate trail through a park 
     Find a walk - friendly race to train for 
     Walk the perimeter of a familiar building 
     Find an audiobook or a playlist for stimulation during your walk 

 6. Body weight workouts 

 7 best exercises for seniors ( and a few to avoid ! ) 

 Muscle loss can be devastating and debilitating for older adults. Around a third of seniors live with severe muscle loss, which can lead to hormone problems, a decrease in the ability to metabolize protein, and other problems. Body weight workouts are one of the best ways to counteract the effects of muscle atrophy in older adults. One of the key benefits of body weight workouts is the affordability. The materials required for body weight workouts are minimal ; most body weight workouts require workout clothes and a mat to soften impact with the floor. 

 Some great body weight workouts for seniors include : 

     Squats to chair 
     Stepup 
     Bird dog 
     Lying hip bridges 
     Side lying circles 

 
 7. Dumbbell strength training 

 7 best exercises for seniors ( and a few to avoid ! ) 

 Strength training has been shown to alleviate the symptoms of diabetes, osteoporosis, back pain, and depression, while helping you manage your weight. Strength training also contributes to a higher metabolism and enhanced glucose control. Dumbbell exercises are some of the best ways for seniors to strength train, if they are performed with the proper precautions. Dumbbells allow seniors to isolate muscle groups to strengthen, while improving balance and flexibility. 

 Some ideal dumbbell workouts for seniors include : 

     Bent - over row 
     Tricep extension 
     Bicep curl 
     Overhead press 
     Front raise 










 Physical activity guidelines for older adults 

 Older adults should do some type of physical activity every day. It can help to improve your health and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. 

 Speak to a GP first if you have not exercised for some time, or if you have medical conditions or concerns. Make sure your activity and its intensity are appropriate for your fitness. 

 Adults aged 65 and over should : 

     aim to be physically active every day, even if it is just light activity 
     do activities that improve strength, balance and flexibility on at least 2 days a week 
     do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity a week or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity if you are already active, or a combination of both 
     reduce time spent sitting or lying down and break up long periods of not moving with some activity 

 If you have fallen or are worried about falling, doing exercises to improve your strength, balance and flexibility will help make you stronger and feel more confident on your feet. 
 What counts as light activity? 

 Light activity is moving rather than sitting or lying down. 

 Examples of light activity include : 

     getting up to make a cup of tea 
     moving around your home 
     walking at a slow pace 
     cleaning and dusting 
     vacuuming 
     making the bed 
     standing up 

 What counts as moderate intensity activity? 

 Moderate intensity activity will raise your heart rate, and make you breathe faster and feel warmer. One way to tell if you 're working at a moderate intensity level is if you can still talk, but not sing. 

 Examples of moderate intensity activities include : 

     walking for health 
     water aerobics 
     riding a bike 
     dance for fitness 
     doubles tennis 
     pushing a lawn mower 
     hiking 

 Try our Fitness Studio exercise videos. 
 What counts as vigorous intensity activity? 

 Vigorous intensity activity makes you breathe hard and fast. If you 're working at this level, you will not be able to say more than a few words without pausing for breath. 

 In general, 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity can give similar health benefits to 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity. 

 Most moderate intensity activities can become vigorous if you increase your effort. 

 Examples of vigorous activities include : 

     running 
     aerobics 
     swimming 
     riding a bike fast or on hills 
     singles tennis 
     football 
     hiking uphill 
     dance for fitness 
     martial arts 

 Try our Fitness Studio exercise videos. 
 What activities strengthen muscles? 

 To get health benefits from strength exercises, you should do them to the point where you need a short rest before repeating the activity. 

 There are many ways you can strengthen your muscles, whether you 're at home or in a gym. 

 Examples of muscle - strengthening activities include : 

     carrying heavy shopping bags 
     yoga 
     pilates 
     tai chi 
     lifting weights 
     working with resistance bands 
     doing exercises that use your own body weight, such as push - ups and sit - ups 
     heavy gardening, such as digging and shovelling 

 Try exercise routines, including : 

     strength and flexibility exercises 
     sitting exercises 
     strength exercises 
     flexibility exercises 
     balance exercises 

 You can do activities that strengthen your muscles on the same or different days as your aerobic activity – whatever is best for you. 

 Muscle - strengthening exercises are not always an aerobic activity, so you will need to do them in addition to your 150 minutes of aerobic activity.

  While everyone can benefit from lifting weights, older adults can reap even more benefits if they work toward a stronger, healthier body. Having a strong body helps you avoid injuries, falls, pain, and other issues associated with getting older. 

 For example, you will gradually lose muscle mass as you age if you do not do anything to maintain it.1 When you keep or gain more muscle, you may actually live longer and you will certainly have a better quality of life. 

 This total body workout is a great way for older adults to get started with strength training. The exercises focus on building total - body strength with an emphasis on improving balance, stability, and flexibility.

 Why You Need Strength Training 

 Strength training can help improve overall health and longevity. It is one of the best ways to keep your muscles strong and can preserve independence and energy as you age. Its benefits include:2 

     Build and maintain strength 
     Maintain bone density 
     Improve balance and coordination 
     Improve mobility 
     Reduces risk of falls 
     Maintain ability to perform everyday activities 

 Strength training also requires minimal time commitment, making it a great option to fit into your schedule. 
 Getting Started 

 The key to starting weight training, if you 're new to it or it is been a long time, is to gradually ease into lifting weights.3 Lifting weights can cause soreness, which is normal, but it should not cause too much pain or discomfort. 

 See your healthcare provider before trying this workout if you have any pain, injuries or other health conditions. Take your time with the moves and only add weights or resistance when you feel comfortable with the exercises. 
 Equipment Needed 

 Various weighted dumbbells, resistance bands, a medicine ball, a chair, and a step or staircase. 
 Workout Basics 

     Begin with a 5- to 10 - minute warm - up of light cardio, such as walking in place. 
     When you first start, perform each exercise for one set, using no weight or light weights. Weights are suggested for each exercise, but choose your weight according to your fitness level and goals. Focus on your form before adding weight. 
     To progress, add a set each week until you 're doing a total of three sets of each exercise with 30 seconds of rest in between each set. 
     Do this workout one or two nonconsecutive days a week, taking at least one day of rest between workouts. 
     If you do feel very sore, give yourself extra rest days as needed and back off during the next workout. 

  

      

 A squat is a movement we do all day, getting up and down from chairs, in and out of cars, and more. Practicing this move with good form will help you build strength in the hips, glutes, and thighs. 

     Stand in front of a chair with feet about shoulder - width apart. 
     Bend the knees. Send the hips back and the arms straight out in front of you to balance. 
     Sit all the way down. As soon as you make contact with the chair, stand back up. 
     Try to stand up without rocking back or using momentum. Instead, put the weight on your heels and push into the floor to stand up. 
     Perform 12 reps. 

 Modifications 

     Easier : Place your hands on your thighs for support, or position your chair next to a rail if you need more support in standing up. 
     Harder : Hold weights in your hands for added intensity. 

 Knee Lift With Med Ball 
 Knee Lifts with a Medicine Ball 

      

 This move is great for working on upper body endurance as well as balance and stability. 

     Hold a light weight or medicine ball ( 2 to 5 pounds ) in both hands, straight up over your head. 
     Lift the right knee up to waist level while bringing the arms down, touching the weight or the ball to the knee. 
     Lower the right knee and take the ball all the way back up overhead. 
     Now lift the left knee to hip level, bringing the ball down to the knee. 
     Return to start and repeat, alternating sides. 
     Continue for 30 to 60 seconds. 

 If you have back or knee problems, you may want to avoid the upper body portion of the move and just do the knee lifts. 
 Modifications 

     Easier : Use no weight, or hold the weight at chest level as you lift the knees. 
     Harder : Speed the movement up, while still maintaining control of the weight and your body. Lift the knees as high as you can. 

 Side Leg Lift 
 Side Leg Lifts 

      

 This move improves your balance as well as strengthening both legs. The standing leg has to use more stabilizer muscles to keep you balanced, while you build strength in the hips and glutes with the lifting leg. 

     Stand sideways to a chair or wall for support and wrap a resistance band around your ankles ( optional ). Or you can use light ankle weights ( 1 to 5 pounds ). 
     Shift the weight into the right leg and lift the left leg out to the side, foot flexed and hips, knees and feet in alignment and feet parallel. 
     Try to lift the leg without tilting at the torso. Hold the torso upright as you lift the leg a few inches off the ground. 
     Lower back down. Do 12 reps on each leg. 

 Lat Pull With Band 
 Lat Pulls 

      

 This move strengthens the lat muscles on either side of the back. You use these muscles for pulling movements like opening doors or picking things up. 

     Stand or sit, holding a resistance band over your head with both hands. Your hands should be wider than shoulder - width so that there is tension on the band. You may need to adjust your hands to change the tension. Make sure your back is flat and your abs are engaged. 
     Keep the left hand in place and contract the muscles on the right side of your back to pull the elbow down towards the rib cage. 
     Press back up. Do 12 reps on the right side. 
     Switch sides and do 12 reps on the left side. 

 Bicep Curl 
 kettlebell curl 

  

 This exercise strengthens your biceps, muscles that you use every day when you carry things, open doors, or pick things up. 

     Stand with feet about hip - width apart and hold dumbbells in each hand ( 5 to 8 pounds for women, 8 to 15 pounds for men ). Alternatively, you can use a kettlebell as shown. 
     With your palms facing out, contract the biceps and curl the weight up towards your shoulder. Try not to move the elbow as you curl the weights up. 
     Lower the weight back down, but keep a slight bend in the elbow at the bottom. Do not swing the weight. Keep the elbows static as you curl the weights. 
     Do 12 reps. 

 Tricep Extension 
 Medicine Ball Triceps Extension 

  

 The triceps work hard every time you do any kind of pushing movement, so you want both sides of the arm to be strong and balanced. 

     Sit or stand, holding a medicine ball or a weight in both hands ( 4 to 10 pounds for women, 8 to 15 pounds for men ). 
     Take the weight straight up overhead, with your arms straight and next to the ears. 
     Slowly bend your elbows, taking the weight back behind the head until your elbows are at about a 90 - degree angle. 
     Squeeze the arms to pull the weight back to start without locking the elbows. 
     Do 12 reps, keeping the back straight and the abs in. 

 Bird Dog 

      

 This move strengthens the abs as well as the lower back and glutes. If your knees hurt or you ca not kneel, try the move lying flat on the floor. 

     Begin on your hands and knees with your back straight and the abs pulled in. 
     Lift the right arm up until it is level with the body and, at the same time, lift the left leg up and straighten it until it is parallel to the floor. 
     Hold for several seconds, lower and repeat on the other side, this time lifting the left arm and right leg. 
     Continue alternating sides for 12 reps. 

 Modifications 

     Easier : Lift the arms and legs separately. 
     Harder : Add ankle weights and/or hold a small weight in your hand while lifting the arm. 

 Ball Tap 

 This move is great for the core as well as for balance and stability. 

     Sit in a chair and place a ball in front of both feet. This can be any kind of small ball or even a large book or some other object if you do not have a ball. 
     Sit straight up. Try not to rest against the back of the chair. Keep your back straight and your abs contracted. 
     Place your hands behind your head ( optional ). Lift your right foot and tap the top of the ball. 
     Take it back down to the floor. Switch sides and do the same with your left foot. 
     Repeat for 30 to 60 seconds, alternating each foot for all repetitions. 

 Step - Up 

 This exercise strengthens the muscles that support the knee. If you have knee problems or this bothers you, you might want to skip this exercise. 

     You can do this exercise on a staircase with rails, or on a workout step if you have one. 
     If you 're on a staircase, stand at the bottom step and step up with your right foot. Bring your left foot up onto the stair next to your right and then step it back down on the floor ( hold onto a rail if you need to ). 
     Keep your right foot on the step the entire time as you step up and down with the left foot. 
     Do 12 reps on that foot and then switch, keeping your left foot on the step as you step up with the right leg. 
     Do 1 set of 12 reps on each leg. 

 Hamstring Curl 

 This move works the back of the legs, muscles that also support the knees. You can also use ankle weights instead of a resistance band. 

     Stand in front of a chair and hold onto it for balance if you need to. 
     Loop a resistance band around your ankles ( optional ), keeping it looped under the standing foot. 
     Bend your right knee, bringing your foot up behind you, kind of like you 're kicking your own butt. 
     Keep the right knee pointing towards the floor and right next to your left knee. 
     Slowly lower back down. Do 12 reps on each leg. 

 Incline Push - Up 

 Push - ups work the upper body and this version allows you to gradually ease into push - ups using a wall rather than doing them on the floor. 

     Stand a few feet away from a wall or stair rail and tilt slightly forward, back flat and abs in. 
     Place the hands on the wall at chest level, wider than the shoulders. 
     Pull the abs in. Keeping the back straight, bend elbows and lower body towards the wall until elbows are at 90 - degree angles. 
     Push back to start and repeat. 
     The farther away from the wall you are, the harder the exercise. Make sure you do not sag in the middle. Keep the abs tight and the back flat. 
     Do 12 reps. 

 Chest Squeeze With Med Ball 

 This exercise strengthens the upper body, including the chest and arms. 

     Sit on a chair, back straight and abs in. 
     Hold a medicine ball or weight ( 4 to 6 pounds ) at chest level. 
     Hold the weight so that the elbows are bent and out to the sides and you 're putting even tension on the ball with both hands, squeezing the chest. 
     Holding that tension, slowly push the ball straight out in front of you at chest level until the elbows are straight. 
     Continue keeping tension on the ball. It should feel harder the farther out you go. 
     Bend the elbows and pull the ball back to your chest. 
     Do 12 reps. 

 Lateral Raise 

 This exercise works the shoulder muscles that you use every time you lift something or put something up on a shelf. 

     Stand with feet hip - width apart and hold weights in both hands at your sides ( 3 to 8 pounds for women, 5 to 12 pounds for men ). 
     Keeping a slight bend in the elbows and the wrists straight, lift the arms up to the sides. 
     Stop at shoulder level with palms facing the floor. 
     Lower back down. Do 12 reps. 

 Seated Rotation 

 Seated rotations work all of the muscles of the torso, including the abs and back. 

     Sit tall on a chair and hold a medicine ball or weight ( 5 to 8 pounds for women, 8 to 15 pounds for men ). 
     Hold the weight at chest level, with shoulders relaxed and elbows out to the sides. 
     Keeping the hips and knees facing forward, rotate the torso to the right as far as you comfortably can. 
     Focus on squeezing the muscles around your waist. 
     Rotate back to center and then to the left, keeping the movement slow and controlled. 
     Continue alternating sides for 12 reps. One rep is a twist to both the right and left. 

 Safety Tips and Precautions 

 If you have any health conditions, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider before you begin strength training so that you are aware of any individual precautions. 

 Start slow and give yourself plenty of breaks between exercises. Remember to breathe throughout the moves and back off if you experience any pain. 

 There are also some times when it is important to take a break and check in with your healthcare provider before continuing with strength training. This includes:2 

     You feel ill and/or have a cold, flu, or infection with a fever 
     You have a swollen or painful muscle or joint 
     You experience significantly more fatigue than usual 
     You feel dizzy or struggle to maintain your balance 

 As long as you communicate with your healthcare provider and take a break if something feels off, you should be able to use strength training to improve your health and reap its many benefits as you age.

     Bend your knees and lift your feet so your calves are parallel to the floor. 
     While drawing in your belly button and exhaling, bring one knee to your chest while reaching for it with your elbow on the opposite side. It should look almost as if you were pedaling a bicycle. 
     Repeat on the side, and continue with repetitions for 30 seconds. 
     Rest for one minute, and repeat with another 30 - second set. 


 Seated Twists

 V. Cardio and Low - Impact Exercises for Seniors 
 Speed Drills - Step Ups and Water Aerobics 

 Speed Drill 

     Draw a ladder design on the floor with chalk or tape. 
     Walk through the steps of the ladder by putting one foot in a square, then bringing the other foot into the same square. 
     Move to the next square and continue until you reach the end of the ladder. 
     Turn around and repeat. 

 Step - Ups 

     Begin at the bottom of a set of stairs. Step on the first stair with your left foot. 
     Then, lift your right foot off the floor and hold it in the air for one second. 
     Step down with your right leg, then the left. 
     Repeat on the opposite side and repeat 10 times per side. 

 Water Aerobics 

 Keeping impact low on the body during exercise may be required by some for many reasons including arthritis and joint pain. For this reason, water aerobics has become a popular choice form of exercise for seniors. It is a safe and effective way to get a workout for the entire body without traditional weights. 

 Water aerobics helps build strength and endurance and since most classes are taken in shallow water, even seniors who do not know how to swim can participate. Gyms and community pools usually provide these classes. Some popular water aerobic exercises include aqua jogging, leg lifts, including various balance and strength builders. 

 Biking and Tai Chi Biking & Elliptical 

 For a low - impact workout, consider bicycling and the elliptical machine. These may not be the first exercises to come to mind for low - impact exercises, but they are effective options since they transfer minimal shock to your joints and your body. Both exercises are easy on your joints and body in terms of impact. 

 Cycling on the road and on a stationary bike are both viable options for a low - impact workout. If cycling on the road, you can use an electric bicycle for exercise and also as an effective form of commute. The assistance from the motor helps through tough terrain and makes hills easier, allowing To make it even easier on your back and neck, a recumbent bicycle is a good alternative as well. 

 While it might not seem like a low - impact exercise, cycling is actually very easy on the joints since your body absorbs minimal shock from pedaling. You can ride a stationary bike at the gym or invest in a road bike to pedal around your neighborhood. If an upright bicycle is too hard on your back, neck and shoulders, try a recumbent bike instead. Unlike an upright bike, where you ’re bent over the handlebars, a recumbent bike allows you to sit back with the pedals and handlebars right in front of you. 
 Tai Chi 

 The fact that most tai chi practitioners begin after the age of 50 is a clear sign that it is a good form of exercise for seniors. Tai chi is type of meditative exercise that focuses on slow, low - impact movements, and breathing technique. 

 Tai chi has been shown to improve balance, strength, and flexibility while remaining gentle on the joints. Its routines are adaptable to your skill level and you do not need any kind of equipment to start practicing, so it is easy for anyone to get started. 

 As you advance, tai chi routines and forms can get advanced, keeping you challenged, and working out your cardiovascular system at the same time. 
 VI. Strength Exercises for Seniors 

 Squats, Bicep Curls and Wrist Curls 
 Partial Squat & Half - Squat Against a Wall 

     Begin standing up, using a chair for support. 
     Bend your knees as far as you comfortably can without having your knees pass your toes, then return to the starting position. 
     Repeat 10 times. 
     For a more advanced version try the half - squat against the wall : perform this against the wall and bend your knees to almost 90 degrees as if you were sitting on an invisible chair. 

 Wrist Curls Place your forearm on a chair is armrest with your hand hanging over the edge. 
     Hold a weight with your palm facing upward. 
     Slowly bend your wrist up and down, then repeat 10 times. 
     Switch sides, and perform 10 reps with your other hand. Repeat one more set of 10 on each side. 

 Bicep Curls Choose a dumbbell heavy enough that you can only complete 10 - 12 reps. 
     Begin sitting in a chair with one dumbbell in each hand, with your palms facing forward, keeping your elbows close to your sides. 
     Bend your arm at the elbows to lift the dumbbell ¾ of the way to your shoulders, without moving your elbows away from your side. 
     Do 10 to 12 repetitions per arm. 

 Upright Rows 

 Upright Front Row 

     Begin standing with your feet shoulder - width apart, knees slightly bent, and partially leaning forward. 
     Hold one dumbbell in each hand in front of you, with palms facing toward your body. 
     Lift both dumbbells toward your chin while keeping your back straight and shoulders stationary. 
     Return to starting position and repeat 10 times. 

 Knee Extensions 

     Begin seated in a chair with your back straight and knees bent. 
     Slowly extend your right leg forward and hold for a few seconds before lowering back to starting position. 
     Repeat with your left leg. 
     Do 10 reps per leg.

 1. Ease Into the First Few Weeks of Training 

 I find beginners are ready to crush themselves in their very first workout. In other words, go too hard, which is not advised. 

 I recommend that lifters ease into their workouts by stopping just shy of all - out failure on all exercises, at least for the first two weeks. 

 This does not mean you are not training hard, it means that you ’re giving your body the chance to adjust to the extra stimulus. 

 The reality is as a beginner you are literally starting from nothing. 

 You can do very basic exercises, with moderate to hard effort, and get good results. 

 While those beginner gains will last only a few months, it is important not to go too aggressive as it will not help you get anywhere faster. 

 In fact, it may derail you right out of the gates due to injury, excessive soreness, and the inability to work out multiple times a week because you are too “ beat up ”. 
 2. Focus on Completing At Least 12 Workouts in the First 30 Days 

 I give all my new clients a goal of working out 12 times in their first month. 

 If they can master carving out time to get 12 workouts in ( on average 3 per week ) over a 30 - day period, they will have made the necessary behavior changes to stick with going to the gym long - term. 

 Getting started as a beginner can be tough, as you need to create a new lifestyle routine to accommodate you going to the gym, working out, and then coming home. 

 If you also have to do that before or after work, you will need to pack a bag and some meals. 

 Like any habit, working out is all about repetition and making consistent practice. 

 12 workouts in 30 days not only provide the muscles with enough stimulus to get stronger, but it gives you the opportunity to create a whole new system on how to allocate your time. 
 3. Choose 5 - 6 Total Exercises to Do Each Day 

 I suggest that every beginner finds a program that has them doing no more than 6 exercises on a single day. 

 Ideally, you would be choosing 2 - 4 compound exercises, and another 2 - 3 isolation - type movements to build out a good workout program. 

 As a beginner, it can be tempting to do every exercise you see on social media on a single day. You are constantly bombarded by “ new cutting - edge workouts and exercises ”. 

 If you train more than 3 days a week, you would simply just add more workouts during the week, but still, keep the same number of exercises per workout.

 4. Keep Workouts Under 1 Hour 
 keep workouts under 1 hour 

 I recommend beginners get efficient with their workouts, i.e. do a lot of work in a short amount of time.   The idea is to push yourself hard to get a full workout done in an hour. 

 Beginners often struggle with two things. 

     The first is being consistent in the gym, often saying they do not have enough time to get three or more workouts in during the week. 

     The second is when they are at the gym, they often have less than optimal workouts because they are too busy getting distracted. 

 Both of these can be solved by having a clear workout program that is designed for beginners and can be done in under an hour.   This will keep you focused and feeling like you ’re accomplishing a lot by the end of the workout. 

 Once you get three workouts a week at an hour each, and you are doing all your exercises every workout with efficiency, look to add another workout in the week to take your results to the next level. 


 I suggest you turn your phone to not disturb mode, and switch over to airplane mode so you can not access social media or emails. 

 The phone is a huge distraction in the gym. Most lifters will rely on their phone for everything : looking at their workout program, texting people during workouts, surfing social media, and answering emails ( or even taking calls ). 

  
 6. Stay Off Social Media 

 Stay off social media ! We live in a time where everyone is connected on social media, and the gym is no different. Too often I see people ( not just beginners ) on Instagram, Tik Tok, and Facebook mindlessly scrolling between sets. 

 This is one of the fastest ways to lose precious minutes in your workout, and not lose focus. I tell my clients that if they have enough time to do mindless things between sets, they have rested long enough. 

 You should be working hard enough to warrant your rest period, which typically consists of you sitting down, catching your breath, shaking your muscles, and mentally recovering for your next set. 

 Any more than that, and you are just waiting time. 
 7. Time Your Rest Periods 

 I often find beginners either rest no time at all or rest an eternity between sets. Both are wrong. The reality is, most beginners can get by resting 90 seconds between sets. 

 This allows you to recover from a tough set, but also keep the stimulus on the muscle enough between sets to have a compounding fatigue effect ( basically, over the course of the workout you want the muscles to tire out ). 

 While more advanced lifters may need longer than 2 minutes, most beginners are not strong enough relative to their body mass and abilities to warrant a very long rest period like you would see in elite - level powerlifters.

 Starting a fitness journey can be intimidating. There are workouts to learn, diets to follow, willpower to conjure, and self - consciousness to overcome. But making the decision to start a fitness regimen and making strides toward improving your health are the absolute best things you can do for yourself — mind and body.. 

 Here, Eric answers the most common training questions he gets from people who are starting their quest toward fitness. 


 I do not know how to use the equipment or do any workouts. How do I get started? 

 As a complete beginner, the gym can certainly be an intimidating place. This is why I suggest hiring a personal trainer for a good eight to 10 sessions. He or she can teach you what muscle groups each piece of equipment works, as well as proper exercise technique, breathing patterns, and rep cadence. A good trainer will also help you develop a workout program that is suited to your present level of fitness, particular goals, and that addresses any injuries or limitations that you may have. 




 What type of training should I do to lose weight? 

 When it comes to losing weight, you need a combination of weight / resistance training and cardiovascular exercise. Many people make the error of performing too much cardio and neglecting weightlifting, thinking that only treadmills, stationary bikes, and stair steppers are responsible for burning fat — but this is far from true. 

 While cardio will certainly help you burn extra calories, it is weight training that is going to stimulate the metabolism ( so that you become a fat - burning machine ), change the composition of your body, and bring about the shape and contours you want. I suggest at least three to four days per week lifting weights and four to five performing cardio — preferably first thing in the morning or right after resistance training.

 What type of training should I do to build strength and muscle? 

 For building strength and muscle, you will need a well - designed weight training program that primarily utilizes free weights and compound ( multi - joint ) exercises. A four - day - per - week program works quite well for most, using a two on, one off ; two on, two off pattern. This allows you to hit each muscle group hard once per week, while providing you three days for rest and recovery ( which is when actual growth takes place ). 

 I suggest starting with about four exercises for three sets each for major muscles like back, quads, hamstrings, chest, and shoulders. For smaller groups like biceps, triceps, traps, abs, forearms, and calves, you will do well with just three movements for two to three sets each. Perform one to three warmup sets before each exercise ( more are needed earlier in the workout ), and then work sets of 13 to 15, 10 to 12, and 7 to 9 reps. 


 Beginner Workout 


 How often do I need to work out? 

 How often you need to work out depends on your fitness level, goals, and time limitations. The loftier the goal, the more time you will have to spend going after it. That said, if you have a very demanding job, a family, or other important personal responsibilities, you may not be able to spend hours per week working out. Then you will need to be patient when it comes to reaching your goal. 

 To make decent progress you need to hit the gym at least three days per week for an hour at a time. However, as time passes, you will begin to require more time in order to see continued progress. I suggest starting out with three gym sessions per week and adding to your program every month or so. 


 How much time should I spend in the gym? 

 Like the last question, this depends on how fit you currently are, what goals you have set for yourself, and how much time you have to devote to working out. For some people it may be best to schedule three hour - long workouts per week, while others may find it more convenient and beneficial to train five to six days per week — but for only 30 minutes. 

 In other words, it is best to think about how many total hours per week you will spend in the gym, and then decide how best to spread it out. Another important point to consider is quality of time and not just quantity. Someone who is very dedicated and focused on their training can often get far more accomplished in just 30 minutes than someone who is there for an hour, but constantly distracted by their phone, chatting with others, and watching rather than doing. 

 Resting 


 How much rest do I need? 

 Certain exercises are far more demanding on the body than others and require more rest between sets. For example, a set of 15 reps of barbell squats will not only tax the thighs, glutes, and lower back, but will also have you breathing like a freight train. You may find that you need a good three to four minutes before you are ready to get to the next set. On the other hand, performing 15 dumbbell side laterals may only require 45 to 60 seconds of recovery time. 

 Another point to consider is what your primary goal is and how weight training will work best to reach it. Someone who is in the gym to build massive size and power will want to rest for longer periods in between sets so as to be able to lift maximum weight for maximum reps. When you ’re looking to burn body fat and increase endurance, it is best to keep heart rate elevated and move quickly from set to set, even if the weights are lighter. 

 As for between workouts, you may find that as a beginner that a full day of rest is needed in between weight training sessions. However, as you progress and become more resilient, it is possible to train for days without a break, just as long as you never work the same muscles two days in a row. Cardio can be done daily. 


 Should I start a supplement regimen? 

 In the beginning of your health and fitness journey, the main focus should be on implementing an intelligent and efficient workout regimen and a healthy and balanced nutrition program. Anyone who tells you to immediately jump on all sorts of sports supplements is either misinformed or trying to make a buck ( well, most of them ). After spending eight to 12 solid weeks in the gym, working hard and consistently while carefully following a sound diet, it is appropriate to think about adding supplements into the mix. 


 Is there really a 30- to 60 - minute window to consume protein post - workout? Why? 

 It is actually true that within the first hour after working out intensely with weights, the body is in a special metabolic state where protein and carbohydrates are partitioned toward muscles and away from fat cells. This is because during this period, insulin sensitivity is extremely high, which means amino acids and carbs will very readily be absorbed, assimilated, and stored directly into damaged muscle cells. This allows for repair, recovery, and recuperation to start immediately, and over time you will get far better results than eating your post - workout meal outside of this anabolic window. 

 Out of Shape Training

 I ’m severely out of shape. Is there anything that is not safe for me to do? 

 While it is likely safe for you to begin a light workout program, preferably under the care of an experienced and educated personal trainer, it would be best for you to consult with your physician before even stepping into a gym. Getting the green light from your doc will give you peace of mind and keep you from needlessly causing yourself harm, illness, or injury, especially when you are taking steps to improve your health and wellness. Do not be disheartened ; just talk to your doctor first to get a physical and come up with a strategy. 


 Do you recommend any non - workout activities to get fit? 

 Absolutely, yes. Not only are outside activities great for your body, they have been proven to improve your mental wellbeing — depression is often a factor for people who find it difficult to get in shape. These types of activities are especially great when it comes to getting in your cardiovascular training. It is far more enjoyable to hike, dance, bike, run stairs, or swim than to walk on a treadmill every session. 


 Body Fat Calipers 

 How do I know my training is working? What performance measures should I be tracking? 

 Carefully tracking your progress is extremely important when embarking on any kind of physical fitness program. If possible, it is a good idea to meet with a coach or trainer every two to four weeks to have your weight, body fat, and complete measurements taken. You can take it a step further by having regular blood tests via your primary physician if you are trying to regulate general health measures like total cholesterol, ratio of LDL to HDL, triglycerides, and blood pressure. 

 Oddly enough, a very good indicator of progress is feeling how your clothes fit. Obviously if you are looking to get bigger and more muscular, you know you are headed in the right direction if your shirts are fitting tighter in the arms, chest, and through the back. The scale is not always a telltale sign of whether your program is yielding results, since it is very possible for people, especially women, to drop several sizes without losing a single pound. Always remember that muscle weighs more than fat, but it takes up far less space. 


 What do I do when I hit a plateau? 

 When stagnation sets in, it is time to look carefully at your overall program and decide what changes need to be made to kickstart progress once again. Sometimes it is a case of simply adding in more work or tweaking your diet by adding or subtracting calories ( depending on the goal ).   times you have to ask yourself if you are truly giving it 100 percent every day in the gym. Simply showing up is not going to get the job done — you need to focus, concentrate, and give your all to every set and rep. 

 Another possibility is that your body and mind have adapted to the exercises and types of cardio you have been doing and need a change. Try changing some of your weight training movements, switching to different cardio machines, using more or less resistance, or altering rest between sets. 


 I ’m really struggling, how do I stick with it? 

 This may be the toughest question of all to answer. The desire and will to keep pushing yourself day after day has to come from within. While the people close to you may lend their support ( and you should question anyone who does not ), it is still you that has to take the journey. You ’re the one who has to skip the cheat meals, pass on the booze, pump the weights, and sweat on the treadmill, bike, and stepper. 

 But just like anything in life, few things worth having come easy. And honestly, nothing is more important than your health. That said, a few suggestions I have that may help are : 

     See if a friend, family member, or another gym goer will work out with you. It is great having a partner. 
     Watch inspirational videos or movies that can help psyche you up to go to the gym. 
     Always wear headphones with your favorite motivational music when you work out. 
     Contemplate how you will feel about quitting. Think about looking back months from now and knowing what you might have accomplished had you stuck with it.

 1. Push - Up 

 The push - up is one of the most basic and effective moves for improving upper body strength. And it really could not be easier to do. You get on all fours, keep your back straight, and repeatedly lower yourself down and up — working the chest, triceps, and shoulders. Your core will also benefit, as the push - up is a moving plank that stabilizes your entire body. 

 The push - up is an exercise you can do anywhere with no equipment. It activates your core from front to back and strengthens your entire torso in the process. 
 How to Do It 

     Get into a plank position with your feet together and hands underneath your shoulders. 
     Keep the abs tight and your butt just slightly up. 
     Lower yourself under control until your chest is about an inch from the floor. 
     Hold for a beat, and then drive yourself back up. 

 Coach is Tip : Keep your elbows directly atop your wrists the entire time. 

 Sets and Reps : Start simple with 3 sets of 10. 
 2. Squat 

 The squat is regarded as one of the best movements — loaded or unloaded — for improving mobility and taxing your legs. Some even refer to the squat as the king of all lifts. You should be squatting if you want to sprint faster, jump higher, lift heavier, and look better. 

 You will improve mobility as the squat has your body move through multiple planes of motion to complete the exercise. Moreover, you stand to gain more leg muscle as the squat targets your glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves, and hip flexors. 
 How to Do It 

     Stand tall with your feet in a comfortable stance. The width and toe angle is entirely individual, so take time to find out what your body feels best doing. 
     Extend your arms in front of your torso as a counterweight, then slowly sit your pelvis downwards. 
     Sink as deep as possible while keeping a straight back before standing back up. 

 Coach is Tip : Fix your gaze on a stationary object or point several yards in front of you. 

 Sets and Reps : Try 3 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions to build endurance. 
 3. Inverted Row 

 Think of an inverted row as pull - up lite. You ’re pulling less of your body weight, so it is easier to do for beginners while virtually recruiting the same muscles as a pull - up. The inverted row is technically a horizontal rowing movement, as your body is parallel to the floor, making it comparable to cable rows. 

 That said, it is a lower impact than both of those moves since you ’re not using weight to stress your muscles but are instead fighting gravity. Advanced trainees can bust out many reps to further tax their backs. 

 The inverted row is helpful for both beginners who ca not pull up their entire body weight and advanced gym - goers who want to perform high - rep back movements. It is also extremely low - impact, since you are not axially loading your spine. 
 How to Do It 

     Lay a barbell into the hooks of a power rack, and set a few feet off the ground. 
     Lay under the bar so the barbell is over the chest. 
     Extend your arms up and grab the bar. 
     Squeeze your shoulder blades together and row your chest to the bar or as close as possible. 

 Coach is Tip : The bar should be set high enough that your butt and back hover above the floor. 

 Sets and Reps : Start with 3 sets of 8 and build from there. 
 4. Chin - Up 

 This pull - up variant has you supinate the hands ( turn them inward ) when pulling your chin to the bar. Like a pull - up, the chin - up recruits the back muscles — the lats, rhomboids, and traps — but with more emphasis on the biceps. Because of the extra biceps recruitment, most people are generally stronger in this position and can pump out a few extra reps. 

 The chin - up teaches you to control your entire bodyweight, build a stronger ( and broader ) back, and even throws in some “ free ” biceps training as well. Economically, pull - up ( or chin - up ) bars are quite affordable for your home gym. But you can also get them done just about anywhere that has a stable surface to hang from. 
 How to Do It 

     Hang from a pull - up bar with your palms facing towards you, set about shoulder - width apart. 
     Squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull up until your chin is at or above the bar. 

 Coach is Tip : If you ca not do a chin - up yet, try jumping up to get into the top position, and hold yourself in that position for 10 seconds. Do this a few times, aiming to increase your hold time. 

 Sets and Reps : Start with 3 sets of 3 - 5 reps and add reps until you can do 10 or more before loading. 
 5. Glute Bridge 

 This exercise is popular among trainers to target the glutes while reducing potential back or knee pain. You can also load the glute bridge to increase your glute strength, which will carry over to your deadlift and squat, or perform sets of them unweighted as a warm - up. If you do not have access to weights at home, you can make the glute bridge more challenging by performing it one leg at a time. 

 The glute bridge allows you to train your glutes without directly loading your spine.   benefits include substantial carryover to your squat or deadlift performance, without overly taxing your hamstrings in the process. 
 How to Do It 

     Lie on the floor with your heels planted firmly on the ground. 
     Contract the core and pull the belly button and ribs into the body. 
     Drive through your heels to lift the hips and lower back off the floor until your torso and legs form a straight line. 

 Coach is Tip : If you feel too much pressure in your lower back, tuck your pelvis under your body to decrease lumbar extension ( minimize lower back arch ). 

 Sets and Reps : Go higher here with 2 - 3 sets of 12 - 20 repetitions. 
 6. Bear Crawl 

 Crawling is not just for babies. By getting on all fours and slowly crawling forward — keeping your back straight and your knees under your hips and an inch off the floor — you ’re teaching the body how to move as one unit. Your core will burn from stabilizing the torso, your quads will engage from propelling your feet forward, and your shoulders will work hard to move your arms. 

 Crawling forward one leg at a time will improve your coordination, and you stand ( or crawl, that is ) to gain some extra range of motion in your shoulder, hip, and ankles as well. 
 How to Do It 

     Get on all fours, with your hands underneath your shoulders and your knees directly underneath your hips. 
     Now, raise the knees an inch off of the ground. 
     Keeping your back straight, simultaneously move your right hand and left foot forward a few inches. 
     Then, repeat on the other side. Keep repeating to crawl on. 

 Coach is Tip : You can also actively squeeze your muscles and hold in this position to perform a bear plank. 

 Sets and Reps : Try 2 to 3 rounds of crawls for up to 30 yards or 40 paces. 
 7. World is Greatest Stretch 

 Mobility is just as important as mass or strength. The world is greatest stretch improves mobility in three key areas — the hips, the shoulders, and the thoracic spine. It has you get into a deep lunge position, touch your elbow to the floor, and then reach up to engage your back and shoulder. 

 You can ( and probably should be ) doing this before any workout — loaded or unloaded — as it is essentially a one - stop - warm - up - shop. That said, you can expect this stretch to activate your back, legs, hips, shoulder, and core during your warm - up. You can also work this stretch into a general warm - up circuit. 
 How to Do It 

     Get into a lunge position so that your front foot is flat and your back foot is on the toes. 
     Lower the opposite arm of your extended leg to the floor and reach your other arm to the ceiling. 
     Hold for 10 seconds, then lower your arm to the same side as your front leg. Repeat on the other side. 

 Coach is Tip : Take your time and focus on your breathing. 

 Sets and Reps : Try 4 rounds per side of 10 - second holds. 
 8. Burpee 

 You may shudder at the word, but the burpee is the ultimate calorie burner. With several variations, the burpee can be great for beginners or challenge the fittest of athletes. This full - body exercise can be seen in gyms almost everywhere and is popular in the CrossFit Games because this high - intensity movement allows you to do more work in less time. 

 Not only do burpees burn a ton of calories while performing them, but they ’re also great at stimulating excess post - exercise oxygen consumption ( EPOC ), meaning you ’re burning more calories for the rest of the day. ( 1 ) 
 How to Do It 

     Stand straight up with your feet shoulder - width apart and your eyes forward. 
     Squat down with your chest up. 
     Drop your hands to the ground and quickly snap your feet behind you, so you are in a plank position. 
     Lower your chest to the floor like you would during a push - up and press back up. 
     Snap your feet back to your squat position and lift your hands off the ground. 
     Stand back up and jump, raising your arms overhead. 

 Coach is Tip : Do not try to jump as high as you can. It is a hop, not a leap. 

 Sets and Reps : Try to do 50 burpees as fast as possible across as many sets as you need. 
 9. Triceps Dip 

 To build bigger arms, the triceps are the muscles to work. Not only can you achieve the desired aesthetic, but there are several benefits to exercising your triceps. Lifts like the bench press can benefit from solid triceps and can help improve your overall upper body strength and stability. Triceps dips in particular are great because they only require your body weight and can be done almost anywhere. 

 The dip builds strength throughout your arms and shoulders, which should contribute toward other exercises like the bench press and overhead press. It also closely mimics the mechanics of other upper - body pressing exercises, doubling down on motor pattern practice. 
 How to Do It 

     Sit on the edge of an elevated surface like a chair or a bench and put your palms on the edge, fingers facing forward. 
     Extend your legs in front of you so your heels are on the ground. 
     Press through your palms and lift your body to hover above the ground. 
     Slowly drop your torso while bending your elbows until you reach the end of your range of motion. Push yourself back up until your arms are extended. 

 Coach is Tip : Dips can be demanding on the shoulders at first, so take things nice and slow if you ’re new to the exercise. 

 Sets and Reps : Go for 2 sets of up to 20 dips. 
 10. Pull - Up 

 The pull - up is one of the harder bodyweight exercises you can do because of the required upper body strength. Even though this exercise targets a big muscle like the lats, weak arms, and shoulders can seriously debilitate your ability to perform even one rep. Plenty of progressions are available to master the pull - up, making it possible for anyone to get their game up. 

 Performing a compound exercise allows you to get more bang for your buck. Studies suggest compound exercises may benefit your VO2 max and general fitness more. ( 2 ) You can also expect the pull - up to improve your overall upper body strength, contributing to better lifts, stability, and posture. 
 How to Do It 

     Find a pull - up bar that is high enough so that your feet do not touch the ground when you hang on it. 
     Grab the bar with an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder - width apart. 
     Pull your shoulders down and away from your ears to engage your lats. 
     Squeeze your core and use your back, arms, and shoulders to pull your body up until the bar is at chest level. 

 Coach is Tip : When you initiate the pull - up, avoid swinging your legs back and forth. 

 Sets and Reps : Start simple with 3 sets of 5 and add reps as you ’re able. 
 11. Plank 

 One of the more popular core exercises is the plank, but it does not only work the core. Holding a plank can also target other major muscle groups in your body. If done properly, the plank can produce many benefits, including improved strength, stability, and posture in the trunk and hips. 

 Benefits of the plank include a stronger core and more protected spine ( as well as better posture ). It goes without saying but a strong core is absolutely essential for compound exercises as well. The plank also has some logistical perks, since you can perform them basically anywhere regardless of your experience level. 
 How to Do It 

     Lie prone on the floor. 
     With your elbows bent, raise yourself off the ground such that you ’re suspended by your forearms and feet only. 
     Squeeze your shoulder blades, tuck your hips slightly, and lock your knees out. 
     There should be a straight line from the base of your neck to your ankles. Hold for time. 

 Coach is Tip : If you ’re timing your sets, avoid looking at the clock and instead listen for an audio cue. 

 Sets and Reps : Start with 3 sets of 20 seconds and build until you can hold the plank for a minute. 
 12. Wall Walk 

 Climbing up walls is not just for Spider - Man. Wall walks recruit your back, arms, shoulders, and core and can help improve balance and stability. Often seen in CrossFit gyms and at the Games, wall walks are a high - intensity way to build strength and get your heart rate up. Performing wall walks can expose and remedy weaknesses in your movement integrity, especially in the core or shoulder. 

 The wall plank is great for developing general upper body strength, and you can also use them as a progression pathway toward more complex drills like handstands, handstand walks and push - ups. 
 How to Do It 

     Lie on your stomach with your hands close to your sides and feet touching the wall behind you. 
     Press your body off the ground and climb your feet up the wall by stepping one foot at a time. 
     “ Walk ” all the way until your arms are fully extended and your belly button is as close to the wall as possible. 
     Walk back down the same way you came. 

 Coach is Tip : Your hands should also move one at a time to support your movement up the wall. 

 Sets and Reps : Start easy with 3 sets of 3 walks. 
 13. Broad Jump Plyometric training can produce benefits pertaining to physical fitness, overall health, and muscle strength. Research suggests that regular plyometrics can positively affect agility, speed, jumping, and overall performance. ( 3 ) Broad jumps involve jumping and absorbing force, increasing your heart rate and teaching your body how to land properly and effectively. 

 Here are the benefits of the broad jump : It trains your body to mitigate ground forces, which can be helpful in exercises like the clean or snatch. Implementing cardio is important for improving overall performance and may reduce risks of heart disease. Finally, explosive exercises like the broad jump recruit fast - twitch muscle fibers, which are used for sprinting, jumping, and other short explosive movements. Studies suggest these muscles are more responsible for producing more power and may aid in heavy lifting. ( 4 ) 
 How to Do It 

     Start with your feet shoulder - width apart. 
     Push your hips back while loading the weight in your heels and swing your arms back to help prime for forward momentum. 
     Drive your hips forward as your feet leave the ground and jump as far forward as you can. 
     Land with a soft bend in your knees and absorb the weight in your heels. 

 Coach is Tip : Stretch your legs out in front of you as you land to gain more distance. 

 Sets and Reps : Try 5 rounds of 5 explosive jumps. 
 14. Lunge 

 The lunge may get less love than the squat, but it is an effective way to target the legs and glutes. This unilateral exercise can improve your balance and stability and requires core activation. With plenty of different lunge variations — walking, forward, reverse, lateral, curtsy, and jumping — you can recruit other muscles, improve function, and add more variety to your workout. 

 The lunge helps develop better balance and coordination, which translate into everyday activities. Lunges also provide some great glute stimulation, even without weights. Finally, unilateral exercises like the lunge can help improve muscle imbalances. 
 How to Do It 

     Stand with your feet hip width apart — this will help you keep a strong and stable base when you step. 
     Keep your chest up and core tight as you step straight forward, bending both knees to 90 degrees or to your range of motion. 
     Press through the heel you stepped with to reset in your starting position. 

 Coach is Tip : Avoid letting your non - working knee touch the floor if possible. 

 Sets and Reps : Start with 3 - 4 rounds of 10 paces per leg. 
 15. Step - Up 

 The step - up might seem self - explanatory, but do not let the simplicity of this exercise fool you. It requires strength and balance and is easily modifiable to accommodate any fitness level. The step - up recruits the muscles in the lower body — quads, hamstrings, and glutes — responsible for walking, running, bending your knees, hinging at your hips, and squatting. Doing this exercise regularly can help improve your lifts and your life. 

 The step - up recruits some of the same muscle used to squat and deadlift, so it can improve these lifts. Unilateral exercises can also promote balance and stability and improve muscle imbalances. 
 How to Do It 

     Stand in front of a stable surface like a bench or a box. 
     Place your working leg on the elevated surface, brace your core, and push yourself up. 

 Coach is Tip : Think of your non - working leg as a kickstand ; its only purpose is to help you keep your balance. 

 Sets and Reps : Try 2 to 4 sets of 10 to 20 steps per leg. 
 16. Box Jump 

 The box jump is a plyometric exercise that uses your quads, hamstrings, calves, glutes, and explosive power to do exactly what the name calls for. Jumping high enough requires strength in the lower body, so you can use a shorter box if needed. However, a great aspect of the box jump is you can continue to challenge yourself by heightening the surface of which you jump onto. 

 Here are the benefits of the box jump : It works as a warm - up for leg day, or as its own main movement if you opt to load it. It also strengthens just about every muscle in your lower body other than your hamstrings. Jumps also improve general athleticism. 
 How to Do It 

     Stand in front of a shin - to - knee height box with your feet shoulder - width apart. 
     Bend your knees and push your hips back to get ready to jump. 
     Push down through the floor with the quads to jump up onto the box. 
     Swing your arms forward as you leave the ground to create momentum. 
     Land on the box with your heels planted and a soft bend in your knees. 

 Coach is Tip : Avoid stomping your feet on the box when you land. 

 Sets and Reps : Maximize your explosiveness with 5 sets of 3 jumps. 
 How to Train With Bodyweight Exercises 

 With weights, you progress by lifting more absolute load or the same amount of weight for more reps. You do not have that option for bodyweight movements, so you will have to rely on additional volume above all. Start by finding how many reps you can do of a bodyweight exercise before your form really breaks down. 
 Exercise Selection 

 Do not try to perform 16 different bodyweight movements per day. The rules of exercise selection are the same ; cluster movements together to double down on muscular stimulation, or pick one for each body part to train yourself from head to toe. For example, a lower - body calisthenics day could contain squats, walking lunges, and box jumps. 
 Sets and Reps 

 Once you have established your limit, perform multiple sets of 3 – 5 reps shy of that limit. If you can do 12 pull - ups, hit three sets of eight. 

 Each week, or workout session, add one to two reps to each set. Once you reach your max reps for all three sets, drop the rep count back to your starting number and add a set. You can also alter the tempo of each movement to make the reps more challenging. 
 Benefits of Bodyweight Exercises 

 There is a lot of upside to training with nothing but your own body. Here, we will breakdown all of the pros of utilizing the moves above, from the positive effects they have on your movement to the fact that they require nearly zero equipment. 
 Easy and Accessible 

 You might want a yoga mat to protect your knees or elbows, but other than that, bodyweight training requires basically no equipment. No matter where you are, you can always bust out a circuit of push - ups, squats, and glute bridges. 

 You can also get creative with how you structure a bodyweight workout at home. Try this deck of cards workout : 

     Assign one move to a suit — so push - ups for spades, squats for clubs, burpees for diamonds, and inverted rows for hearts. 
     Draw a card and perform the move associated with that suit for the number of reps on the card ; or 11 reps for face cards and 15 for aces. 
     Aim to rest as little as possible. If you ’re a bit rusty, cut the deck in half. 

 Improved Mobility 

 Most bodyweight moves mimic everyday life. You squat to get out of a chair ; you lunge when you walk up the stairs ; you technically perform a pull - up when closing the garage door. Most movement patterns can be broken down into six basic categories — a vertical pull, vertical push, horizontal pull, horizontal push, knee - based movement, and a hip - based movement. Here is an example of each : 

     Horizontal push : push - up 
     Horizontal pull : inverted row 
     Vertical push : military press 
     Vertical pull : pull - up 
     Knee - based movement : squat 
     Hip - based movement : glute bridge 

 By performing bodyweight exercises, you ’re improving your proficiency in these patterns and making yourself stronger in these positions. Barbell work accomplishes this as well, of course, but with the obvious caveat that you must have access to weights in the first place. 
 Unparalleled Convenience 

 Unlike powerlifters or strongman competitors who need specialized equipment for their training, bodyweight aficionados can go hard just about anywhere. Since you ’re forgoing the barbell for your own body weight, calisthenics - based routines can be performed wherever you have enough physical space. 
 woman doing decline push - up 
  

 This makes bodyweight training convenient in a way that other activities ca not match. If you spend a lot of time traveling or do not have access to a commercial gym, a good bodyweight routine can help you stay strong and gain muscle. 
 Scalable for All Levels 

 You may think that squatting or doing a push - up with your bodyweight is the ground floor for all exercise, but that is not the case. A true beginner can squat to a chair, hang from a pull - up bar to build their base, or elevate their hands for push - ups on the edge of a couch. 

 And when you eventually outgrow the basic variations above, there are ways to make bodyweight moves harder. Push - ups can be performed with one arm, squats can be turned into 1-½-rep squats, and you can elevate your legs for inverted rows.

  The advantages of body - weight exercise 

 All exercise is beneficial. But even stacked up against other types of workouts, body - weight exercise has a lot to offer. Not only does it provide an excellent work­out, but it can also help you overcome some common excuses for avoiding exercise, like " I do not have time to go to the gym " and " I do not have space for a stationary bike at home. " All you have to do is move your body. 

 Here is a closer look at some of the pluses. 
 It could not be more convenient 

 No matter where you are, you have got your body, so you can start exercis­ing anywhere, anytime — in your bedroom when you wake up, in the kitchen while you ’re waiting for water to boil, in your hotel room when traveling. That makes it easy to find the time. 
 The price is right 

 With body - weight exercise, there is nothing to buy other than a pair of shoes. You do not need stylish clothing. You do not even need a yoga mat, much less an expensive gym membership, although you can certainly do these workouts at the gym, too. You might want a few props, such as a chair, bench, or counter to modify some moves, but these are all items that you have on hand. 
 The intimidation factor is low 

 You can do these exercises solo. You do not have to walk into a gym full of buff exercisers and complicated - looking weight machines that require adjustments and may still not fit you properly. 
 It is effective. 

 Research published in the journal Physiology and Behavior found that, as a form of resistance training, body - weight exercise helps build muscle " independent of an external load. " But it does more than that. When Polish researchers looked at the effects of 10 weeks of body - weight exercises on various physical fitness parameters in a small group of young women, they found improvements in seven out of nine of the parameters. The biggest gains were in aerobic capacity, with a 33 % improvement. Muscle endurance, particularly in the core, increased by 11 %, while lower - body power posted a 6 % gain. Even flex­ibility was better after the training. 
 You do not necessarily have to do a lot of it. 

 While it is good to meet the Physical Activity Guide­lines, smaller amounts of body - weight exercise can also deliver results. In a small study of active people in their 60s, Japanese researchers found that a work­out consisting of eight simple lower - body exercises increased the participants ’ muscle strength and power by about 15 % after 10 months. That may not sound like much, but during this stage of life, strength and power are often declin­ing. What is more, the participants achieved these gains by doing only six workouts a month. 
 It provides " functional " exercise 

 Most body - weight exercises work multiple muscles at once rather than training an isolated muscle or muscle group, as many exercise machines and dumbbell exercises do. Therefore, body - weight exercises are considered more functional, using more muscles and joints at a time, engaging balance and, and mimicking everyday activities. 
 It can be adjusted to your fitness level 

  It may not be obvious how to do this at first. When you ’re using your body as the weight, you ca not just remove 10 or 20 pounds as you can with machines or dumb­bells. But there are ways to modify moves to decrease or increase the resistance. You can adjust your body position — for example, doing push - ups against a wall rather than the floor — or you can change the number of times you repeat an exercise or modify the pace you ’re working at. 
 It is good for your health 

 Literally thousands of studies have shown that the more you move, the lower your risks for heart disease, diabetes, obesity, multiple types of cancer, joint pain, and Alzheimer is disease. Exercise can also lift your mood, reduce your stress level, and improve your sleep. Body - weight exercise is no exception.

 These exercises can be adapted for people of all fitness levels. Hammond recommends doing four sets of each of the exercises below. If you ’re a beginner, start with two sets of 15 reps and increase the number of sets as you get stronger. And if you have an injury or illness that may limit your ability to safely exercise, check with your doctor before starting any new workout program. 

 Note : Some of these moves suggest using a yoga mat. If you do not have one, try using a folded towel or completing the exercises on carpet to lessen the impact on your hands or knees. 
 Chest 
 1. Push - Up 
 push - up 

 Start on your hands and knees on a yoga mat on the floor, with your hands resting slightly wider than the width of your shoulders. Straighten your legs out behind you so you ’re being supported by your hands and the balls of your feet. Keep your body in a straight line from the top of your head to your heels ( holding your head up in line with your spine ). Bend your elbows and lower your chest until it nearly touches the mat. Pause and then push yourself back up to the starting position. If that is too difficult, complete the push - up with your knees on the floor. One set is 12 reps. 
 2. Push - Up Shuffle 
 push - up - shuffle 

 Complete a push - up ( either on your knees or with your legs extended behind you, depending on your fitness level ). Then, keep your core engaged and shuffle your right hand and right foot a step to the right side. Bring your left hand and foot to meet them. Complete another push - up there. Return to center and repeat on the opposite side. One set is five shuffles in each direction. 
 3. Isometric Chest Squeeze 
 isometric - chest - squeeze 

 Stand with your hands in front of you with a 90 - degree bend in your elbows. Hold your hands together and squeeze your chest as hard as you can. Hold the tension for up to 30 seconds and release ; that is one rep.

 Arms 
 1. Triceps Dip 
 tricep - dip 

 Sit in front of a bench or coffee table or at the end of a couch with your legs extended out in front of you away from the furniture. Position your hands on top of the furniture behind you with your hands about shoulder - width apart and your fingertips pointing toward your body. Straighten your arms and pull your body up so it is hovering over the floor. Then engage your triceps muscles as you bend your elbows until they ’re at about a 90 - degree angle. Press down from your hands and straighten your arms to return to the starting position. You should be supporting most of your body is weight in your arms to get the greatest benefit from the move. To make the exercise easier, keep your knees bent at a 90 - degree angle. One set is 12 reps. 
 2. Plank Up - and - Downs 
 plank - up - down 

 Get into a plank position on the floor : Your hands should be on the mat with your shoulders directly above them, legs extended straight back behind you, toes on the mat, and your body forming a straight line from top of head to heels. ( If that is too difficult, you can keep your knees on the floor. ) Lower your left elbow down to the mat and then lower your right elbow down to the mat so you ’re now in a forearm plank. Keep your core engaged and your body in a straight line. Push up and straighten your right arm. Then straighten your left arm as well. Repeat for 30 seconds, switching off which arm goes first ; that is one set. 
 3. Triangle Push - Ups 
 triangle - pushup 

 Settle into a plank position but place your hands close together under your chest and form a triangle with your index fingers and your thumbs ( your thumbs should be in a straight line forming the bottom side of the triangle ). Lower your chest toward the floor as if you were doing a regular push - up, keeping your elbows close to your body. Pause at the bottom and then push off the floor to return to the starting position. Modify by completing the push - up with your knees on the floor or by moving your hands slightly wider than the triangle shape. One set is 12 reps 
 Back 
 1. Superman Y 
 superman - y 

 Lie facedown on a mat with your arms extended in a Y position overhead and your legs are extended directly behind you on the mat. Using your back and shoulders, lift your chest and arms off the mat. Hold and then lower into the starting position. One set is 15 reps. 
 2. Bird Dog 
 bird - dog 

 Position yourself on your hands and knees on your mat with hands beneath your shoulders and your knees beneath your hips. While keeping your core engaged and stable, raise your right arm straight in front of you and extend your left leg straight out behind you, reaching both away from the body at the same time so both are parallel to the floor. Hold, engaging the hamstrings and glutes ; then bring your arm and leg back to center. Repeat with your left arm and right leg. Complete 15 reps on each side for one set.

 Hang from a pullup bar and then swing your body forward a bit, pulling your shoulder blades together so your head and chest move forward. Swing your legs behind you as your chest comes forward. You may need to practice the motion. Now drive your legs forward while you pull up to the bar. The momentum of your entire body will help you up, and you will rise to the bar in an arc rather than straight up. You will feel as if you 're cheating a regular pullup. Once up, try to get the upper part of your abs touching the bar, then straighten your hips and push down on the bar so you suspend yourself over it ( as in a dip ). Lower yourself back down and reset for the next rep.

 If you 're on the hunt for bodyweight exercises that you can do from anywhere ( read : the comfort of your own home ), then you 're in the right place. 

 We 're big fans of simple yet effective home workouts here at     UK - most of us are time short as is, so hour - long weight training workouts that require a drive to the gym just will not be doable. 

 A 20 - minute session you can do from your living room, however, is a whole different matter. You can squeeze in before the kids wake up or when you get home from work, in your pyjamas or favourite gym kit - whatever floats your boat. 

 That said, many wonder whether bodyweight exercises are actually effective or worth your time. For those of you who do not know, the basic definition of a bodyweight exercise is a workout move you do using just the weight of your body - think a push - up, squat, or lunge. 

 Bodyweight workouts utilise resistance so as to create muscle tension, in turn boosting both your strength levels and general fitness. 

 According to    , the fittest woman in the UK, PT and CrossFit coach, there are loads of benefits of doing workouts simply using your bodyweight. " Being able to control your own weight can involve great strength and is a fantastic way to build muscle as well as growing your body awareness, " she explains. " Just look at gymnasts - they largely use their own body weight and are incredibly strong. " 

 Benefits include improved fitness, strength and muscle mass, better blood flow, plus they put less strain on your joints if you 're recovering from injury. 

 " Bodyweight training also allows you to build a strong base with a variety of exercises that can be made more challenging by reps, tempo and inclines, " Campbell continues. 

 To improve your fitness week on week, Campbell and    , gym manager, coach and personal trainer at WIT House London, recommend aiming for progressive overload - that is, gradually increasing the amount of reps or sets of an exercise you do so your body adapts and gets stronger. " As long as you are consistent with the movements and your sessions, you could see results within a month, " Campbell shares.

 Bodyweight exercises : 10 best to try anytime, anywhere 
 1. Air squat 

 According to Campbell, air squats are a great bodyweight move to try at home. " It is a multi - purpose movement in that it can be used to warm up and mobilise your body before lifting weights, performed in volume to build leg endurance, or done as part of a recovery routine by promoting blood flow to your legs and glutes. " 

 He agrees, adding that they 're a great lower body movement to improve mobility of your ankles, knees and hips and also leg strength. 

 How to : Imagine you ’re sitting on a chair, with your hips go back and your knees forwards. Keeping your chest up, keep sitting down until your hips are ideally below the parallel line of your knees. Then stand up. Sometimes raising your arms to eye level as you descend can help to maintain your chest position in this movement, so try that if you find you ’re leaning forwards too much. 

 How long : Start with 5 rounds of 20 air squats. When you 're used to that, try adding time under tension, advises Campbell - aim to take 4 seconds to get from standing to the bottom of the squat, as a start point. 
 2. Lunges 

 Next up? The humble lunge. Often overlooked, this bodyweight exercise has a multitude of benefits and can be performed in a variety of ways, share the experts. " They work your stability and balance as well as requiring the single leg strength to drive from the bottom position, " shares Campbell. 

 How to : Bring one leg out in front of you, and as your foot lands on the floor lower down your back knee to touch the floor with your front leg creating a right angle. Drive back up from the front leg to standing. 

 How long : Start with 5 rounds of 20 and build from there. 
 3. Jumping lunges 

 Jumping lunges, according to Campbell, are great for explosive strength and building leg endurance via lactate threshold training ( aka when lactate acid builds up in your blood faster than the body can remove it ). " This means you will be able to work for longer and at a higher intensity, " she explains. 

 How to : Perform as a regular lunge - as above - but instead of stepping into each position, jump explosively. 

 How long : Build up with a few sets of 10 to 16 reps. 
 4. Push up 

 A push up is one of the best shoulder exercises you can do, plus the most basic form of pushing strength. " It can also be easily scaled to suit all abilities, " shares Campbell. 

 How to : Begin in a top plank position with your hands underneath your shoulders and lower your chest down to the floor whilst maintaining the same body position. Once your chest has touched the floor, push yourself back up to your starting position. This can be scaled to lowering yourself down to a bench or box – this is preferable to a kneeling push up as it includes the full range of motion and maintains the core demand of the movement. 

 How long : To build strength with these you want to aim for progressive overload where you increase the reps or sets you perform each session. For example, one week you could perform 3 sets of 6 to 8, then the next week, aim for 3 sets of 8 to 10. Either way, your workload is increasing and your body is therefore working harder and will need to adapt to get stronger. 
 5. Ring row 

 This is another great movement that can be easily adapted to make it challenging for people of all abilities. " They 're incredibly underrated and a great way to build lat and back strength, too, " shares Campbell.  

 How to : With your feet on the floor, either the full foot for more support or just heels to make it harder, begin with your arms fully extended and lats engaged by pulling your shoulder blades back and down. Pull the rings in to touch your chest and lower back to the start position in a controlled manner. To make it more difficult, make your body more horizontal or elevate your feet on a box or bench. 

 How long : Like push ups, you want to build reps week on week where you push yourself a bit more each session. Aim for 3 sets of 6 to 8 and progress from there. Try adding a pause at the top or a tempo on the way down for ultimate bang for your buck. 
 6. Pull up 

 A pull up is another seriously simple yet effective bodyweight move - it is one of the most pure and simple forms of strength and further motivates so many women to get stronger in the mission to get a pull up. Again, unless you have a sturdy enough piece of kit at home, do try this one at the gym, too. 

 How to : Start with your arms fully extended hanging from a bar and initiate the movement by squeezing your shoulder blades together to avoid overly using your traps. Pull up until your chin is above the bar, squeezing your legs together throughout the rep. Lower yourself down in a controlled manner to your starting position. 

 How long : If you can perform one rep or less, practising negative pull ups so you ’re able to eventually do more. " This means that you jump to the top of the pull up position and control the descent, " explains the expert. 

 If you can perform at least two reps, she advises gradually add reps or sets on each session. 
 7. Wall walks 

 Wall walks are a simple movement but simultaneously very humbling and deceiving, shares Campbell. It is a great way of building shoulder strength in a way that is a bit different, plus it is slightly more fun than other movements, she reckons. 

 How to : Start with your body face down on the ground with your hands by your shoulders and feet touching the wall. Push back into a down dog position before placing your feet on the wall and then moving your hands and feet at the same time up the wall until your hands are a couple of inches away from the wall and body in one line. Lower yourself back to your starting position in a controlled manner. To scale these, perform with your feet on a box or bench and stop when your hands are underneath your hips. 

 How long : To build up your capacity add in more reps or sets each time you perform them. Start by aiming for 3 sets of 6 to 8. 
 8. Sit ups 

  Top tip : fold a towel up and place it under your lower back for support and full range of motion. 

 How to : Start by lying down on your back with your feet flat against the floor and your knees bent. With hands on either side of your body, brace your core and raise your upper body off the floor, sitting up towards your knees until you are upright. Then, bracing your core again and being careful not to strain your neck, lower yourself back towards the ground. Repeat. 

 How long : Aim for 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps. 
 9. Plank 

 You will all have heard of a plank, but for good reason - according to the trainer, it is a great move for core stability which will transfer over to other moves, such as squats and deadlifts, and also improve your posture. 

 How to : Start with your elbows, forearms, and toes on the floor so you are holding your body in a straight line. Keeping your core tight, your spine neutral and your shoulders braced, hold the position, remembering to breathe. 

 How long : Aim for 3 sets of 45 to 60 seconds. 
 10. Burpees 

 Last but by no means least, another bodyweight move you will have heard of is a burpee - a high intensity interval training move that will get your heart rate up and boost your cardio. 

 How to : Start by standing with your feet beneath your hips, arms by your side. Lowering yourself into your standard squat position, put both hands on the floor and jump your legs back into a plank position. Bracing your core, bring yourself back up to your starting position and repeat. 

 How long : Aim for 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps. 
 What happens if I only do bodyweight exercises? 

 As Campbell explains, bodyweight exercises - such as air squats or lunges - are good to incorporate in lighter or active recovery sessions. " Many athletes include them in their training programmes and studies have proved can massively benefit your training, " she shares. 

 " Performed at the correct intensity for each individual, they will promote blood flow to the muscles helping to speed up recovery without putting them under too much strain with added load from a weight, " she continues. 

 Additionally, the muscles ’ time under tension can easily be manipulated in these exercises through alterations in the tempo of the movement, or by adding pauses. 

 In short, bodyweight exercises are a great way for beginners to build both muscle and strength.

 Do resistance bands work for building muscle? 

 In short, yes, resistance bands are effective for building muscle. “ The key to helping your muscles grow is tension, sufficient recovery, muscle adaptation, and progressive load, ”   says, all of which are feasible through using resistance bands alone. 

 That said : If you ’re an * avid * user of resistance bands ( like, you ’re banding up every single day ), know that in the future you will need to up the ante : “ Your body will eventually get used to these bands, even the heaviest ones, and you will want to incorporate weights to further enhance your strength, ”   says. It is all a part of continuing to progress your weight load and challenge your bod. 

 For example, you can do moves like deadlifts, squats, and glute bridges with both a resistance band and a dumbbell to give your workout that extra difficulty of tension — resulting in more room for muscle building. 

 The following are the 22 best resistance band exercises for you to try at home or in the gym, according to expert trainers.

 Rock out with the band ! Resistance bands are a great addition to any strength training routine or rehabilitation program. They come in a variety of sizes, lengths, and resistance levels. 

 They ’re also portable and easy to store, so they ’re perfect for home use, hotel workouts, or making the most of a small space at the gym. 

 Just like free weights, exercise bands come in a range of resistance levels, from highly stretchable to heavy - duty strength. 

 The most common types of bands are tube bands with handles, loop bands, and therapy bands. If you ’re in doubt, a fitness professional can help determine which band is right for you, depending on your fitness level and your specific workout plan. 

 For most exercises, try aiming for 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 25 reps per exercise.

 How to choose the right resistance band 
  

 Resistance bands come in many forms and are used for various types of workouts, including physical therapy, pre - workout mobility warmups, strengthening muscles, speed and agility drills, and stretching. There are a few different types of resistance bands you can choose from, depending on your goals. Some look like a long, round tube with handles at each end, while others that take the shape of a shorter closed loop. Resistance bands that are longer with handles can be used for more upper body and full body workouts, whereas the shorter closed loop resistance band is best for legs, glutes, and lower body,   says. 

 Resistance bands are inexpensive compared to machines and require little storage space, making them a great option to have on standby. He recommends incorporating resistance band exercises 2 - 3 times a week in conjunction with weights and different forms of cardio, like walking or swimming. 
 How do resistance bands work? 
  

 When you use a resistance band, it stretches to create tension, and your muscles have to overcome this oppositional force. In doing so, your muscles work harder, resulting in stronger, more defined muscles. “ You can add them to weighted bars to increase the resistance, and they help you improve range of motion when weights stop working because of gravity. ” 

 They can also be your gym buddy when you want to go deeper into an exercise or stretch. “ When stretching, resistance bands can take the place of another person to extend your reach and provide pressure, ”   says. “ They also require more core activation for most moves. ” 

 Resistance bands are also a safe way to fight osteoporosis and increase bone density. “ There is less force on the joints, so if you are recovering from an injury or have joint pain, these can be your best friends, ”   says. This makes them great for beginners. “ Resistance bands are versatile and can be used for many muscle groups while being easy on the joints. Everyone from beginners to bodybuilders can use them effectively. ”

   5–6 of these exercises to make one challenging routine : 
 1. Rotational jacks 

 A twist on a jumping jack, rotational jacks are a good way to kick off a workout. They will get your heart rate up and muscles warm. 

 Directions : 

     Start in a wide stance with soft knees. Your 
     arms should be extended straight out at your sides so they ’re parallel to the 
     ground. 
     Keeping your arms straight and head and neck 
     stationary, hinge forward at the hips and rotate your torso so your right hand 
     touches the ground. 
     Return to the starting position and jump your 
     feet together. 
     Immediately jump your feet back out, hinge 
     forward again, and rotate to the left, touching your hand to the ground. 
     Return to start. Jump your feet together and 
     twist again to the right. 
     Complete 12–15 reps for 3 sets. 

 2. Plank reach - under 

 Planks are a basic ( but not easy ! ) exercise that provide full - body benefits. Adding the reach - under targets your core even more. 

 Directions : 

     Assume a high plank position on your hands. 
     Ensure your core is braced and your lower back does not sag. Your neck and spine 
     should be neutral. 
     Lift your right hand off the ground and back 
     toward your left thigh, tapping it with your fingers. Return to a plank. 
     Repeat with your left hand, tapping your right 
     thigh and returning to a plank. 
     Complete 3 sets of 20 total taps. 

 3. Step - ups 

 Step - ups will burn your lower half. Plus, they ’re great for working on balance and stability, too. 

 Directions : 

     Start standing in front of a knee - height bench, 
     or step with your feet together. 
     Step onto the bench with your right foot, 
     pushing through your heel and driving your left knee up. 
     Lower your left leg down, stepping backward off 
     the bench. 
     Complete 10–15 reps with your right leg, then 
     switch and complete 10–15 reps, leading with your left leg. 
     Complete 3 sets. 

 4. Mountain climbers 

 No need for weights when you can do a few sets of mountain climbers. Supporting your own body weight — in combination with the knee drive — will have your muscles, and lungs, on fire. 

 Directions : 

     Assume a high plank position with your arms 
     extended. 
     Engaging your core and keeping your spine and 
     neck neutral, drive your right knee up toward your chest. Extend it and 
     immediately drive your left knee up toward your chest. 
     Repeat for 30 seconds, going as fast as you can 
     while maintaining good form. 
     Complete 3 total sets. 

 5. Squat jumps 

 Plyometrics are exercises that require your muscles to exert a lot of force in a short period of time. Squat jumps are a prime example. You will get a lot of bang for your buck with just a few sets of these. Warning : They ’re high - impact, so if your joints are sensitive, proceed with caution. 

 Directions : 

     Lower into a squat position with your arms bent 
     and hands together out in front of you. 
     Explode up into a jump, pushing through and 
     landing back on the balls of your feet. 
     When you reach the ground again, squat down and 
     repeat. 
     Complete 3 sets of 10–12 reps. 

 6. Burpees 

 Another type of high - impact plyometric exercise, burpees are a full - body move that will torch calories quickly. 

 Directions : 

     Start by standing straight with feet shoulder - width 
     apart and arms down by your sides. 
     Start to squat down, moving your hands out in 
     front of you. As soon as they reach the ground, extend your legs straight back 
     so you end up in a high plank position. 
     Immediately after you reach the high plank 
     position, jump your feet up to your palms by hinging at the waist. Get your 
     feet as close to your hands as you can get, landing them outside your hands if 
     necessary. 
     Stand up and immediately go into a jump squat. 
     After you land, extend your legs back out again, 
     continuing steps 3–4. 
     Start with 15 reps. 

 7. Standing side hops 

 Lateral ( side - to - side ) movements are an important component of a well - rounded exercise regimen. Standing side hops are great for hip and ankle mobility. 

 Directions : 

     Start standing with your feet together and your 
     arms bent at a 90 - degree angle at your sides. Your knees should be soft. 
     Keeping your feet together, jump to the right, 
     taking off and landing on the balls of your feet. 
     As soon as you reach the ground, jump back to 
     the left. 
     Repeat 20 reps for 3 sets. 

 8. Pullups 

 A standard pullup is challenging to complete, even for avid exercisers. Its payout is worth it, though. Use a pullup band for assistance and still reap the benefits. 

 Directions : 

     Stand underneath a pullup bar and grip it with 
     your hands, placing them slightly wider than shoulder - width apart. 
     Lift your feet off the ground and hang from your 
     arms, then pull yourself up by bending your arms and pulling your elbows toward 
     the ground. 

 9. Squat pulses 

 Holding a squat position and pulsing there increases time under tension, or the amount of work your muscle does during a workout. Feel that burn ! 

 Directions : 

     Get into a squat position with your hands 
     together out in front of you. 
     Raise up slightly, pushing through your heels, 
     then back down again. 
     Repeat for 30 seconds. 
     Complete 3 sets. 

 10. Flutter kicks 

 Although they target your core, flutter kicks also zero in on the hips. Three sets of these will have you feeling it the next day. 

 Directions : 

     Lie on your back on a mat with your legs 
     extended into the air so your body forms a 90 - degree angle. 
     Slowly lower your right leg down toward the 
     ground as far as it will go while maintaining contact between your lower back 
     and the ground. 
     Return your right leg to start, and lower your 
     left leg down the same way. 
     Complete 20 total reps for 3 sets. 

 11. Pushups 

 Foundational but not a cinch, pushups require upper body strength, yes, but also core and lower - body stabilization. Easily modifiable ( drop to your knees or perform off an elevated surface like a bench ), they ’re a universal exercise. 

 Directions : 

     Start in a plank position with your pelvis 
     tucked in, neck neutral, and palms directly under your shoulders. Make sure 
     your shoulders are rotated back and down, too. 
     As you brace your core and keep your back flat, 
     begin to lower your body by bending your elbows while keeping them tucked into 
     your body. Lower down until your chest grazes the floor. 
     Immediately extend your elbows and push your 
     body back up to the starting position. 
     Repeat for as many reps as possible for 3 sets. 

 12. Broad jumps 

 Yet another high - impact move ( noticing a pattern here? ), broad jumps require lots of force, thus they burn lots of energy. 

 Directions : 

     Start standing with your feet shoulder - width 
     apart and your arms down at your side. 
     Squat down halfway, and use that explosive 
     energy to jump forward, throwing your arms forward at the same time. 
     Land with a soft foot and your weight slightly 
     forward. 
     Complete 10 reps for 3 sets. 

 13. Split squats 

 Any exercise that works your glutes, quads, and hamstrings — the largest muscles in your body — is bound to pay out big. Split squats are just that. 

 Directions : 

     Take a large step forward with your left foot to 
     form a staggered stance. Distribute your weight evenly between both feet. 
     Bend your knees and lower your body down until 
     your left knee forms a 90 - degree angle. 
     Push up and repeat for 12 reps. Switch legs and 
     repeat.

 These calisthenics exercises can keep you fit and healthy for a long time if done regularly. Full - body exercises at home. such as circuit training, workouts, isometric exercises, plyometrics ( that involves stair workouts ), chair exercises, hip bridges, bicycle crunches, HIIT ( high - intensity interval training ), yoga, shadowboxing, supermans and dance workouts, and Russian twists may help you shed some extra weight and improve your overall fitness. But if you are a beginner, you must keep certain things in mind. 
 Things To Remember 

     Do not try complex moves. Start with stretching and full - body workouts like jumping jacks, box jumps, and basic squats. This will help your body slowly adjust to the new regimen. 
     Involve your entire body. This includes your lower body, the sides, the upper body, and the core. This way, you will engage all the muscle groups. 
     Do not strain too much. If you are feeling any discomfort, stop. Allow your body to completely cool down. 




















 there is pretty much no science behind the cool - down advice. 

 The cool - down, doctor   said, “ is an understudied topic. ” 

 ” Everyone thinks it is an established fact, ” he added, “ so they do not study it. ” 

 It is not even clear what a cool - down is supposed to be. Some say you just have to keep moving for a few minutes  walking to your car after you finish a run rather than stopping abruptly and standing there. Others say you have to spend 5 to 10 minutes doing the same exercise, only slowly.   after your run, then transition into a walk. Still others say that a cool - down should include stretching. 

 And it is not clear what the cool - down is supposed to do. Some say it alleviates muscle soreness. Others say it prevents muscle tightness or relieves strain on the heart. 

 Exercise researchers say there is only one agreed - on fact about the possible risk of suddenly stopping intense exercise. When you exercise hard, the blood vessels in your legs are expanded to send more blood to your legs and feet. And your heart is pumping fast. If you suddenly stop, your heart slows down, your blood is pooled in your legs and feet, and you can feel dizzy, even pass out. 

 The best athletes are most vulnerable, said doctor    , a cardiologist and marathon runner who is an exercise researcher at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut. 

 “ If you are well trained, your heart rate is slow already, and it slows down even faster with exercise, ” he said. “ Also, there are bigger veins with a large capacity to pool blood in your legs. ” 

 That effect can also be deleterious for someone with heart disease. “ That is always a concern, ” doctor   said. “ But to my knowledge there is not a wealth of experimental data. ” 

 But does it matter for the ordinary, average athlete? “ Probably not a great deal, ” doctor   said. And, anyway, most people do not just stand there, stock still, when their workout is over. They walk to the locker room or to their house or car, getting the cool - down benefit without officially “ cooling down. ” 

 The idea of the cool - down seems to have originated with a popular theory  now known to be wrong  that muscles become sore after exercise because they accumulate lactic acid. In fact, lactic acid is a fuel. It is good to generate lactic acid, it is a normal part of exercise, and it has nothing to do with muscle soreness. But the lactic acid theory led to the notion that by slowly reducing the intensity of your workout you can give lactic acid a chance to dissipate. 

 Yet, doctor   said, even though scientists know the lactic acid theory is wrong, it remains entrenched in the public is mind. 

 “ It is an idea we ca not get rid of, ” he said. 

 In fact, doctor   said, one study of cyclists concluded that because lactic acid is good, it is better not to cool down after intense exercise. Lactic acid was turned back into glycogen, a muscle fuel, when cyclists simply stopped. When they cooled down, it was wasted, used up to fuel their muscles. 

 As far as muscle soreness goes, cooling down does not do anything to alleviate it, doctor   said. And there is no physiological reason why it should. 

 That is also the conclusion of a study of muscle soreness by South African researchers who asked 52 healthy adults to walk backward downhill on a treadmill for 30 minutes  an exercise that can cause sore leg muscles. The participants were randomly assigned to cool down by walking slowly uphill for 10 minutes or simply to stop exercising. The result, the researchers reported, was that cooling down did nothing to prevent sore muscles. 

 And muscle tightness? 

 “ In a different generation we would have called it an old wives ’ tale, ” doctor   said. “ Now I guess I ’d call it an old physiologists ’ tale. There are no data to support the idea that a cool - down helps. ” But, he added, once again, “ it is an idea we ca not get rid of. ” 

 Exercise researchers say they act on their own advice. 

 doctor   says if he is doing a really hard track workout he will jog for a short distance when he finishes to avoid becoming dizzy. If he runs a half marathon, he will “ start shuffling forward, ” after he crosses the finish line, for the same reason. 

 As for doctor  , he does not cool down at all. He is a soccer player and, he says, he sees no particular reason to do anything after exercising other than just stop. 








 15 minute fitness 




  Do not have 15 to spare? Baloney, Facebook friend.  Facebook user spends almost 6 1/2 hours a month on the site. Guess how much time that works out to a day? Nearly 15 minutes. It is time to edit your profile. 

 According to a recent study in the European Journal of Applied Physiology, 15 minutes of resistance training can elevate your resting energy expenditure for 72 hours after exercise just as effectively as 35 minutes can. That means you will burn off your gut and build muscle faster than you ever thought possible. 

 Even the most prolific poster can do it. Now there is a new tool to help make the excuses harder to muster : The Men is Health Big Book of 15 - Minute Workouts is available this month.

 You might love a long workout as much as the next gym nerd. But sometimes you ca not spend hours in the gym. You might be traveling, working hard at that new job, or just need to squeeze in an extra training session at home. The good news is, 15 - minute workouts can help you stay on track with your goals, improve your conditioning, and even make you stronger. 

 If you ’re used to working out for much longer periods of time, the idea of training for only 15 minutes might seem ridiculous. But 15 - minute workouts can help you target your weak spots as an athlete. If you do not have the space in your programming to focus on building endurance, peppering in 15 - minute workouts throughout your week can help you do that efficiently. Because such short workouts should generally be intense, they will build multiple benefits at once — strength and endurance, for example. 
 A person performs incline pushups outside. 
  

 This article will take you through five of the best 15 - minute workouts according to your goals, and you will learn about why they ’re so good to integrate into your program. You will also learn how to incorporate these short workouts into your training and how to warm up for them. 
 Best 15 Minute Workouts 

 15 Minute Workout for Strength 

 Yes, you can get stronger while working out for only 15 minutes at a time. You need more than 15 - minute sessions to train for a max deadlift, for example — but that does not mean a short workout ca not make you stronger. Use your 15 - minute sessions to focus on movement patterns you might normally breeze through to make the most of your training. 
 The Workout 

 Instead of aiming for maximum reps, you will aim to perform each movement with slow control. To build strength, you will perform 1 ½ reps with most of your exercises. Doing your reps this way will increase your time under tension, which is key for getting you a lot stronger. You can perform this workout two to four times a week. 

 Round 1 ( 8 minutes ) 

     1 ½ Push - Up : 1 minute 
     Rest 30 seconds. 
     1 ½ Bulgarian Split Squat : 30 seconds per side 
     Rest 30 seconds 
     Superman : 1 minute 
     Repeat round once 

 Round 2 ( 7 minutes ) 

     Bodyweight Squat : 1 minute 
     Rest 30 seconds 
     1 ½ Close - Grip Push - Up : 1 minute 
     Rest 30 seconds 
     Reverse Snow Angel : 30 seconds 
     Repeat round once 

 15 Minute Workout for Muscle Growth 

 Because you will only be working for 15 minutes total, you will pack as many reps as possible into the time you have to work out. You also will not be resting all that much. That means that you will be placing your muscles under a lot of mechanical stress. That kind of stress is exactly what you need to help stimulate hypertrophy. 
 The Workout 

 You will be minimizing rest time with the structure of this workout, but make sure you are actually taking the rest that is prescribed. You want to be able to maintain effectiveness and excellent form, even as you push yourself. Try this workout two or three times a week. 

 Round 1 ( 10 minutes ) 

      
     Rest 30 seconds 
     Alternating Bodyweight Lunge : 2 - minute  
     Rest 30 seconds 
     Bodyweight Skull Crusher : 1 - minute 
     Repeat round once 

 Round 2 ( 5 minutes ) 

     Alternating Jumping Lunge : 45 seconds 
     Rest 15 seconds 
       Push - Up : 45 seconds per side 
     Repeat round once 

 15 Minute Workout for Conditioning 

 The great thing about 15 - minute workouts is that they ’re designed to be intense by nature of how short they are. Because of this intensity, you will likely boost your conditioning even if your main focus is hypertrophy. That said, having a short workout focused solely on conditioning will allow you to go through exercises that are designed to get your heart rate up while making you stronger. 
 The Workout 

 Especially if you ’re not used to intensive conditioning work, take it easy on your frequency. Even performing this workout once a week will be helpful for someone who might lift regularly, but is unused to rigorous conditioning training. That said, feel free to perform it up to three or four times a week if you are more practiced in this area. 

 Round 1 ( 6 minutes ) 

     Burpee : 1 - minute  
     Rest 60 seconds 
     Repeat round twice 

 Round 2 ( 5 minutes ) 

     Bear Crawl : 1 - minute  
     Rest 30 seconds 
     1 ½ Jump Squat : 1 - minute  
     Repeat round once 

 Round 3 ( 4 minutes ) 

     Clapping Push - Up : 30 seconds  
     Rest 30 seconds 
     Bodyweight Glute Bridge Hold : 60 seconds 
     Repeat round once 

 15 Minute Workout for Endurance 

 All well - designed 15 - minute workouts will likely build your endurance — especially if you ’re not used to short, intense bursts of work. But there are some that specifically target endurance more than others. Focus on form throughout this workout especially. It takes a lot of mental effort to improve your endurance, and you will have to channel a lot of that effort into maintaining good form while you ’re fatigued. 
 The Workout 

 In this workout, you will either be working longer or minimizing your rest periods even more in each round. Especially at first, this might not actually translate into performing more total reps. Because you ’re pushing yourself to have so little rest, your body might actually hit failure sooner. That is okay — log your numbers and keep pressing on. 

 Round 1 ( 7 minutes ) 

     Push - Up : 90 - second  
     Rest 30 seconds 
     Bodyweight Squat : 90 - second  
     Rest 30 seconds 
     Marching Glute Bridge : 90 - second  
     Repeat round twice 

 Round 2 ( 5 minutes ) 

     Left Side Plank : 1 - minute  
     Rest 30 seconds

 15 Minute Workout for Mobility 

 Improving your mobility is going to help you get stronger — period. Even if your primary goal in typical training is strength or hypertrophy, focusing on mobility during your shorter sessions is a great idea. The more mobile you are, the more successful your lifts will be. After all, overhead lifts, squats, and deadlifts all require solid top - to - bottom mobility. 
 The Workout 

 This workout might feel less intense than the others — you will not be jumping around as much, for example. But if you ’re not used to mobility work, this short mobility session might feel extremely draining. That is okay — pushing yourself to improve strength at your end ranges of motion is demanding work. Even so, you might want to perform this workout every day. It will not require a lot of you in terms of recovery, and it will give you ample benefits on the lifting platform.

 Benefits of 15 Minute Workouts 

 For athletes who love lifting, 15 - minute workouts can be tough to swallow. Fifteen minutes is just enough time to warm up for a decent workout — what could you possibly get from exercising for just 15 minutes before calling it a day? You can get quite a lot, actually. 
 Time Savers 

 Maybe you do not have time to add a full - out conditioning session to your program. Or maybe you do not have time to hit the gym at all. Whether you ’re using 15 - minute workouts to supplement your training program or your program consists entirely of 15 - minute sessions right now, these short workouts save a lot of time. 
 Cardio and Conditioning Benefits 

 Fifteen minutes of jogging can help improve your cardiovascular health — but a 15 - minute workout can also improve your conditioning. The great thing about using your body weight ( or actual weights ) for cardio is that your heart rate and muscles will get a strenuous workout. This type of conditioning training can get you stronger while you ’re getting your cardio in. 
 A person wearing their hair naturally performs bodyweight squats outside. 
  

 Why is it important for lifters to incorporate conditioning into their training? The more you improve your work capacity, the easier it will be for you to train longer and harder on the platform. Winded after a heavy set of four reps? Even short conditioning workouts like these can boost your work capacity so that you can recover faster and therefore lift heavier. 
 Target Your Weaknesses 

 Especially if you use 15 - minute workouts to strategically target your weak points or secondary goals, you can get a whole lot out of them. If your main goal is to get strong but you also want to get better at cardio, try a 15 - minute conditioning workout. It will focus on both strength and cardio — so you will still be getting stronger, but it will give you a moment to specifically train for your secondary cardio goal. 

 Or, maybe you know that mobility is a general weakness for you. Instead of using your 15 - minute workouts to try and build muscle, try performing short workouts to improve your mobility. This way, you can maximize your time and not feel like you ’re leaving gains on the table by working out so quickly. 
 Consistency 

 Your schedule might not allow you to log hours at the gym every week. Knowing that 15 - minute workouts are all you need to stay on task can help you maintain a consistent training schedule, even when you ’re stressed out or pressed for time. 

 Taking time off from training completely might be a good option for you if you need to prioritize other things in your life — but if you enjoy working out, total time off can be emotionally difficult. Enter 15 - minute workouts. They will keep you on track with your goals but will not eat into your schedule. 
 Who Should Try 15 Minute Workouts 

 Fifteen - minute workouts can benefit a wide range of strength athletes and casual gym - goers alike. If you ’re looking to improve your conditioning, your confidence, or your gym - related time management, 15 minute workouts can help you out. 
 Athletes Looking to Improve Conditioning 

 Athletes from any strength sport can benefit from better conditioning. The ability to work harder for longer without getting overly winded can help powerlifters, weightlifters, and Strongman athletes lift heavier. CrossFitters who are better conditioned can improve their time and efficiency in their next session, and bodybuilders with higher work capacities can lift more efficiently. And the more efficiently you lift, the less energy you waste — thereby giving you more of an opportunity to train hard. 
 Athletes Who Want to Build Their Confidence 

 It can be intimidating to watch people bang out burpee after burpee at the gym. Sure, you can squat well over your body weight, but there is something about being able to exercise sustainably with your own body as resistance. Fifteen - minute workouts can be a great confidence booster for strength athletes who want to feel — and be — more athletic. 

 And if you ’re just trying to get into the habit of working out, 15 - minute workouts can feel a lot more accessible than going to the gym for an hour or so. The more complete 15 - minute sessions you can tick off your list, the more confidence you will gain — and the more sustainable your training will become. 
 Athletes Without a Lot of Time 

 No time to train for the next couple of months? You might not have the same amount of time you have had in the past, but you do probably have 15 minutes at least a few times a week. It can be a great asset to your workout consistency to know that you can get a full, satisfying workout so quickly. Even if you do not get to do everything you want to do within 15 minutes, keeping up with your training when you ’re pressed for time will make it much easier when you do have more time. 
 How to Program 15 Minute Workouts 

 Sometimes, you want to use 15 - minute workouts as supplements to your lifting routine. Maybe you want some bodyweight work on an active recovery day or to add a finisher to the end of a lifting session. Or you might want to slip some conditioning into your training routine. 

 In that case, program your 15 - minute workouts around your recovery and other training needs. You probably do not want to do a push - up - heavy 15 - minute session the day before heavy bench pressing, for example. But you might want to do a leg - intensive conditioning workout the day after heavy squats or deadlifts to help you recover. 

 On the other hand, you may use 15 - minute workouts as your primary or only form of working out for a microcycle. In that case, perform your chosen workouts a few times a week, depending on your training experience and recovery needs. You still have to recover from bodyweight work. Short workouts are intense, so do not come out swinging every day until you ’re used to conditioning work. 

 The exception here is mobility work. You probably do want to aim to do some sort of mobility workout every day. It will help you lift heavier and safer, and the more mobility workouts you do, the stronger you will get in your end ranges of motion. 
 How to Warm Up for 15 Minute Workouts 

 If you ’re doing 15 - minute workouts, it is likely that you do not have a whole lot of time to commit to your sessions right now. But do not let that stop you from warming up properly. To make the most of your 15 minutes, commit to warming up for just a few minutes beforehand. 

 This short but effective warmup routine can help you reduce your injury risk and make your training more efficient.

 Things that take 15 minutes : cooling down after a hot yoga class, deciding what the eff to order for takeout, and debating the caption for your latest Instagram. Here is another to add to that list : a workout that will actually help transform your body. 

 Contrary to popular belief, you do not have to go slog it out at the gym for 30 or 45 minutes. ( Or god forbid, an hour. ) Working out for just 15 minutes — yes, 15!—comes with a slew of health benefits, from upping your calorie burn and whipping your body into shape, to lowering your risk of certain diseases and even adding years on to your life. 

 These quickie sweat sessions are no joke. Count these among your reasons to start carving out 15 minutes of your day : 

 1. Get Results Faster 

 You have heard about HIIT, or high - intensity interval training. There is a reason no one shuts up about it : It really works. Most recently, researchers found that a 10 - minute workout, with just one minute at high - intensity, had the same benefits as 45 minutes of jogging. 
 Related Story 

 One group of study participants did a two - minute warm - up on a stationary bike, followed by a 20 - second sprint, then rode slowly for two minutes. They repeated that sequence two more times for a total of 10 minutes. The other group just rode steadily on the bike for 45 minutes. After 12 weeks, both groups showed a 20 percent increase in cardiovascular endurance. 
 2. Burn More Calories 

 HIIT workouts, which usually lasts just four to 15 minutes, can also give you more bang for your buck in terms of calorie burn. In a study published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, men who did 13 minutes of HIIT burned more calories per minute and increased their VO2 max by 12.5 percent more than men who did steady - state cardio for 40 minutes. More payoff in half the time? Yes, please. 
 3. Live Longer 

 Just 15 minutes of exercise per day could actually increase your lifespan. Scientists from the European Society of Cardiology evaluated study participants over a 12 - year period, and found that those who exercised at a low level ( or the equivalent of a 15 - minute brisk walk ) were 22 percent less likely to die during the study period than those who did not exercise at all. And participants who exercised at medium and high levels reduced their risk of death by 28 percent and 35 percent, respectively. 

 4. Manage Weight 

 The calorie - burning benefits of even the shortest strength - training bout keep coming long after you have left the gym. In a study from Southern Illinois University, researchers found that when volunteers did just one set of nine exercises, or about 11 minutes of strength training, three days a week, they increased their resting metabolic rate ( the calories burned when just hanging out ) and fat burning enough to keep unwanted weight at bay. 
 5. Stay Young 

 HIIT can actually have a profound effect on aging at the cellular level. The older you get, the less efficient your energy - producing mitochondria become. But when researchers analyzed three groups of exercisers over 12 weeks — one that did high - intensity aerobic interval training, one that did resistance training, and one that did a combination of the two — they found that those who did HIIT actually reversed that age - related degeneration. Translation : Their mitochondria actually worked like those of much younger people. 
 6. Boost Your Brainpower 

 You know working out is good for your body, but you probably do not think too much about how good it is for your brain, too. In fact, just 10 minutes of exercise can boost your brainpower for a short time afterward. The researchers found that study participants who rode a stationary bike at a moderate to vigorous pace for 10 minutes answered questions 50 milliseconds faster after exercising than they did before, a 14 percent increase in cognitive performance. 


 7. Lower Your Risk of Certain Diseases 

 Obviously, all exercise has health benefits. But according to a study published in Internal Medicine, participating in 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week can decrease your risk of getting cancer or cardiovascular disease. That is just 12.5 minutes a day. 
 8. Stay Happy 

 Everyone knows about exercise and endorphins. 

 But science actually says that just one hour of exercise per week ( that is less than 10 minutes a day ) could prevent up to 12 percent of depression cases. 

 The study, which was published in American Journal of Psychiatry, followed more than 22,000 healthy adults who did not have symptoms of anxiety or depression for about 11 years. In the end, researchers found the people who reported not exercising at the beginning of the study were 44 percent more likely to become depressed versus those who spent one to two hours working out each week. 

 In another study, people taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder who pedaled on a stationary bike for just 15 minutes lowered their levels of the stress hormone cortisol. 
 9. Have More Fun 

 “ High intensity ” sounds more intimidating than regular workouts, but people actually enjoy HIIT workouts, a lot. When researchers compared reactions to moderate - intensity continuous exercise and HIIT workouts, they found that 92 percent of the study participants reported a preference for HIIT over the moderate - intensity continuous workout — despite the fact that HIIT was harder. 

 The reason they liked it better? Because HIIT is more time efficient and the workout is constantly changing on you. And, you know, the more you like a workout, the more likely you are to stick with it — the rewards will just keep rolling in. 

 If you want to find out for yourself just how effective 15 minutes of exercise can be, give these speedy workouts a try. Just do not try to use your lack of time as an excuse for not working out anymore — that gig is up.

 Do You Need to Live in the Gym? 
 While long, intense muscle building workout plans may work for some because they have a long period of time to dedicate to the gym, the reality is many of us do not have the luxury of this time dedication. Between work, kids, and school, exercise can tend to drop down to the bottom of our priority list because we believe if we are not able to exercise for 2 - 3 hours then it is simply not worth it. 

 If you want to succeed in 2016 it is time to erase that kind of mindset. You can still make gains and reach your fitness goals by setting aside a small amount of time each day to exercise. Ideally, 30 - 60 minutes is a good amount of time to set aside and dedicate for your training. But, what about those individuals who are so strapped for time that giving up even 30 minutes of their day is not feasible? 

 For those who ca not commit a full 30 minutes to exercise and need a quick exercise routine to stay on track with their fitness goals, a 15 - minute full body routine can help you stay on track. 

 In order to perform an effective 15 - minute routine, you want to use strong, compound movements instead of isolation movements. Time is precious here and in order to get the most out of your short workout you want to have as many muscle groups involved as possible. Using compound movements will engage multiple muscle groups to create an overall effective workout. 

 With this type of short workout you also better be ready to hit it hard and get intense. With only 15 minutes to spare for a workout, there is no looking at your phone between sets and simply going through the motions. You need to dedicate this 15 minutes of your day to just your workout. Clear your mind, turn your phone off, crank up the music and focus on yourself and the weights. You want this time to be as effective as possible. 

 And, because time is scarce in this workout fashion you will focus on hitting a push / pull / leg type of workout routine. You want to get your entire upper body and lower body involved as much as possible within these 15 minutes. 

 Now, set the timer and let is pump out some 15 minutes gains.

 Are 15 Minutes Enough To Build Muscle? 

 Yes – a 15 - minute workout is a great way to build muscle if it is all the time you have. It is not optimal, but you can build muscle and improve your physique with even a few small workouts. 

 The real revelation is that 15 - minute workouts will only work as hard as you do. 

 They ’re a workout type that trades time efficiency for hard, balls - to - the - wall work while you ’re doing them. They require you to push the pace for 15 minutes to fit more work into less time. 

 This is why 15 - minute workouts are not more popular : you can fit an hour of workout into 15 minutes if you ’re working 400 % harder. It is a simple but brutal workout style that can build tons of results in nearly no time, but it requires a lot of grit and willingness to keep pushing when tired. 
 Time - Efficiency : How to Make Better Short Workouts 

 How do you make a 15 - minute workout effective for building muscle mass? 

 We have put together a shortlist of the most important things you can do to ensure that your 15 - minute workouts are building muscle and helping you progress. 
 Improve Intensity 

 This is the most important factor : work harder. You ’re not spending much time exercising, so you need to make sure it is spent at the absolute limit of what you can do – safely and with good technique / movement. 

 This means less rest, more challenge, and starting near the maximum of what you can do. 

 That means working on challenging exercises and reps the whole time and being willing to step down to a simpler or lighter exercise as fatigue sets in ; just do not stop. 
 Less Rest 

 If you ’re doing a 15 - minute workout, you want to make sure there is as much exercise as possible – and as little rest as possible. 

 The work needs to take up all of the time while resting is cut back or removed completely. 

 It is more important to stay working to provide more mechanical tension and metabolic stress in the muscle. This is what causes muscle growth, and – with 15 minutes of consistent high - effort work – you can put far more in with less rest. 

 You want to take some rest – but try and structure it. If you ’re spending 15 minutes, try setting out 45 seconds on, 15 seconds off rest structure. If you can do even less, you will spend more time building muscle and catching your breath less. 

 A smooth, consistent pace for 15 minutes means a ton of work – and all the muscle that builds. 
 More Often 

 One of the easiest ways to make your workouts more effective is to do more of them. If you ’re training for 15 minutes at a time, there is no reason you ca not train 6 - 7 days a week. 

 The actual effect on your body may be less than a longer workout, but that means you will be able to work out more often without overtraining. 

 Training for 15 minutes every day of the week still adds up to nearly 2 hours of constant exercise if you ’re pushing the pace. That is more than most people spend exercising across 3, 1 - hour sessions. The results will speak for themselves – especially if you ’re using smart, well - built workouts. 
 Better All - Purpose Workouts with Compound Movements 

 Your workouts should be well put together to get the best from your time. 

 Fifteen minutes is not a long time, but it is enough to train your whole body if you ’re using the right exercises – or a comprehensive muscle group workout if you ’re splitting by body part. This is one of the best times to do a body part split, as long as they overlap ( e.g., arms and back / bis ). 

 Focus on using heavy compound exercises to get a larger impact and ensure proper, well - rounded development. 

 women doing lunges 

 A workout comprising dumbbell squats, RDLs, lunges, a walking dumbbell “ death march, ” and lunges with a calf raise is a simple idea but overlaps to produce a great 15 - minute workout – if you put in the right intensity. 

 Compound exercises let you get more results in less time and should be used to overlap as well as possible, focusing on important muscles and developing their stabilizers and related muscles. 
 Supersets and Circuits 

 Supersets, circuits, and combining different exercises can be a simple but effective way to fit workouts into your schedule. 

 You can perform supersets of opposing movements like dumbbell bench press and dumbbell row. This is an antagonist superset, and it is one of the best ways to work both sides of your body, building more muscle in less time while supporting the joint and improving co - contraction for better strength. 

 On the other hand, you can always use superset or ‘ circuit ’ exercises without overlap. 

 Squats and overhead press do not share much, so you can superset them and keep each exercise relatively fresh. It does not have overlapping benefits – but it will save you a significant amount of time. 
 Be Humble and Work with Light Weights 

 Do not think too much about the weight – there is no way you will perform well for the whole 15 minutes. It takes humility to use a much lower weight than you ’re used to to get better and put in consistent work at a good pace. 

 The more you ’re willing to work in the 50 - 75 % range for your workouts, the more you will get done. 

 You can start with heavyweights, but the focus should be on doing tons of work with back - off sets and trying to build more work capacity. Weight can be high at the start, but you need to up the pace if you can use heavy weights for the whole 15 minutes. 
 Lock Down Your Out - Of - Training Factors 

 There is never a bad time to improve your out - of - training factors : food, sleep, supplementation, hydration, and recovery. 

 The more time and effort you put into the out - of - training factors, the more every rep and minute of exercise will contribute to building more muscle mass. 

 Work on these factors wherever you can and make good choices. They ’re the medium that turns exercise into muscle mass. You may find you ’re gaining muscle faster and more effectively with 15 - minute workouts and a good diet than with longer workouts but worse eating. 

 More protein, carbs appropriate to your daily activity levels, and a small but consistent calorie surplus are the way to make muscles grow. 
 15 - Minute Workout FAQ 
 Is a 15 - minute Workout Effective? 

 15 - minute resistance training or gymnastic workouts can be effective with proper pacing and exercise selection. You need to keep intensity high and rest periods low, but you can pack in tons of great workouts if you ’re smart. 
 How Many Minutes Should I Workout a Day to Gain Muscle? 

 You should exercise 45 + minutes per day, but you can gain muscle with as little as 10 - 15 minutes if you push the pace. This requires lots of work in that small timeframe, which means high - intensity interval training and assigned “ on / off ” periods can help structure workouts. 
 Are 15 minutes of Weights Enough? 

 While it is not optimal, you can build muscle with 15 minutes of weight training. 

 This is enough to stimulate muscle growth and strength gains, especially with compact workouts that use lots of reps at lower weights across the 15 - minute workout. 
 Can I Work Out for 15 minutes Twice a Day? 

 Yes – you can use two workouts a day at 15 minutes each. This might not be optimal for strength and muscle, but it still adds up to a significant amount of exercise and will help you get more muscular, fitter, and stronger. 
 Is Exercising 20 Minutes a Day Enough? 

 Twenty minutes a day is enough exercise to stay mostly healthy, but you should aim for more. 

 If you ’re stuck with a schedule that only allows 20 minutes, that is a good start, and you can still get more muscular, improve strength, and get fitter with this small amount of time. 
 What Happens If You Run 15 Minutes a Day? 

 Running 15 minutes a day is a short workout but will help you build endurance, fitness, and health. It will also improve the strength of the tendons and muscles in your legs and core if your technique is good. 

 Running 15 minutes a day is not optimal for endurance or fat loss, but you can still progress it patiently with intervals, slowly increasing your speed and distance. It is a good place to start ! 
 Can Short Workouts Build Muscle? 

 Short workouts can build muscle, but they typically rely more on shorter rest, lighter weights, and varied exercises. This makes them a great choice for everyday training, which helps you build muscle more effectively. 
 Can You Build Muscle with 10 - minute Workouts? 

 Yes – you can build muscle with a 10 - minute workout – but it will require a much higher pace than a longer workout and may provide sub - optimal results. 

 10 - minute workouts are not the best choice, but they can help you build more muscle and stay fit, especially if you do not have a choice. 

 When you ’re struggling for time, a short workout is better than no workout – and you can still get good results if you push the pace, reps, and sets instead of weight. 
 Is a 10 Min Ab Workout Enough? 

 10 minute workouts are great for abs and core muscles, which lend well to circuits, supersets, and other low - rest training styles. This makes ab workouts one of the best and most intuitive short workouts, even for 10 minutes. 
 Final Thoughts 

 Fifteen minutes is enough to build muscle if you ’re smart about your workouts and push the envelope on intensity and pace. This is a small cost for turning little time into a significant change to your physique. 

 It is going to take some hard work and a lot of sweat, but muscles will respond to the time you spend exercising. There is no secret : cram more work into less time using light weights, smarter workouts, and a higher pace that eschews rest. 

 If you ’re committed to changing your body, 15 minutes spent with a pair of dumbbells – even at home – can be a huge stimulus to change.

 Here are some additional tips for focusing on functional movements, stability, agility, and hypertrophy : 

     Functional movements : When choosing exercises, focus on compound movements that work multiple muscle groups at the same time. These movements are more likely to translate to real - world activities. Examples of functional movements include squats, deadlifts, push - ups, pull - ups, and lunges. 
     Stability : Stability is essential for good balance and coordination. To improve stability, include exercises that challenge your core and smaller muscle groups. Examples of stability exercises include planks, bird dogs, and Russian twists. 
     Agility : Agility is the ability to change direction and speed quickly. To improve agility, include exercises that require you to move quickly and react to changes. Examples of agility exercises include ladder drills, cone drills, and shuttle runs. 
     Hypertrophy : Hypertrophy is the process of muscle growth. To promote hypertrophy, lift weights that are challenging enough to stimulate muscle growth. You should also focus on progressive overload, which means gradually increasing the weight or resistance that you lift over time. 

 By following these tips, you can create a fitness program that will help you achieve your goals of improving functional fitness, stability, agility, and hypertrophy.

 Maximizing Hypertrophy in a 15 - Minute Workout 

 Hypertrophy, the process of increasing muscle size, is a common goal for many fitness enthusiasts. However, finding the time for lengthy workouts can be challenging. Here is how you can target hypertrophy in just 15 minutes. 
 Understanding Hypertrophy 

 Hypertrophy occurs when the fibers of the muscles sustain damage or injury. The body repairs damaged fibers by fusing them, which increases the mass and size of the muscles. To stimulate hypertrophy, exercises should involve high - volume, moderate - intensity workouts, with short rest intervals. 
 The 15 - Minute Hypertrophy Workout 

 This workout is designed to target all major muscle groups, using compound exercises for efficiency. Remember to warm up before starting the workout and cool down afterwards. 

 Warm - up ( 2 minutes ): A quick warm - up increases blood flow and prepares your muscles and joints for exercise. 

 Workout ( 10 minutes ): Perform each exercise for one minute, rest for one minute, then move on to the next exercise. Repeat the circuit twice. 

     Dumbbell Squats : This exercise targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Make sure to keep your back straight and chest up. 
     Push - ups : An excellent exercise for the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Maintain a straight body line from head to heels. 
     Dumbbell Rows : This exercise targets the back and biceps. Keep your back straight and pull the weight up to your chest. 
     Overhead Press : This compound movement targets the shoulders and triceps. Press the weight overhead, fully extending your arms. 

 Cool - down ( 3 minutes ): Lower your heart rate with light cardio, then stretch the major muscle groups to reduce soreness and increase flexibility. 
 Tips for Success 

     Progressive Overload : Gradually increase the weight, frequency, or number of repetitions to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth. 
     Nutrition : Consume a balanced diet with adequate protein to support muscle repair and growth. 
     Rest : Allow your muscles time to recover and grow between workouts. 
     Consistency : Regular workouts are key to achieving and maintaining muscle hypertrophy. 

 Remember, it is important to listen to your body and adjust the workout intensity as needed. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new workout regimen.

 Here are some more specific benefits and advice for bodyweight exercises : 

 Benefits 

     They can help you build muscle. Bodyweight exercises can be just as effective as weight - loaded exercises for building muscle. In fact, some studies have shown that bodyweight exercises can be more effective for building certain muscle groups, such as the core and the hamstrings. 
     They can help you lose weight. Bodyweight exercises are a great way to burn calories and lose weight. They can also help to improve your body composition by reducing your body fat percentage and increasing your muscle mass. 
     They can improve your cardiovascular health. Bodyweight exercises can be used to create interval training workouts, which are a great way to improve your cardiovascular health. Interval training workouts involve alternating between periods of high - intensity exercise and periods of low - intensity exercise or rest. 
     They can improve your flexibility and balance. Bodyweight exercises can help to improve your flexibility and balance by challenging your range of motion and stability. 
     They are low - impact. Bodyweight exercises are low - impact, meaning that they are easy on your joints. This makes them a good option for people of all fitness levels and ages. 

 Advice 

     Focus on compound exercises. Compound exercises work multiple muscle groups at the same time. This makes them more efficient and effective than isolation exercises, which only work one muscle group at a time. Some examples of compound bodyweight exercises include squats, lunges, push - ups, and pull - ups. 
     Use progressive overload. Progressive overload is the principle of gradually increasing the weight or resistance that you lift over time. This is important for stimulating muscle growth and strength. To achieve progressive overload with bodyweight exercises, you can make the exercises more difficult by adding weight or resistance, or by increasing the number of repetitions and sets that you perform. 
     Vary your workouts. To avoid boredom and plateaus, it is important to vary your bodyweight workouts. You can do this by changing the exercises that you perform, the number of repetitions and sets that you do, and the order in which you perform the exercises. 
     Listen to your body. If you are feeling pain, stop the exercise immediately. Do not push yourself too hard, especially when you are first starting out. 

 Here are some specific bodyweight exercises that you can try : 

     Squats : Squats work your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and core. To perform a squat, stand with your feet shoulder - width apart and lower your body down until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Keep your back straight and your core engaged. Drive through your heels to stand back up. 
     Lunges : Lunges work your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and core. To perform a lunge, step forward with one leg and lower your body down until both knees are bent at a 90 - degree angle. Keep your back straight and your core engaged. Drive through your front heel to stand back up. Repeat with the other leg. 
     Push - ups : Push - ups work your chest, triceps, shoulders, and core. To perform a push - up, start in a plank position with your hands shoulder - width apart and your body in a straight line from your head to your heels. Lower your body down until your chest touches the ground. Keep your back straight and your core engaged. Push back up to the starting position. 
     Pull - ups : Pull - ups work your back, biceps, and forearms. To perform a pull - up, grab a pull - up bar with an overhand grip, shoulder - width apart. Hang from the bar with your arms fully extended. Pull yourself up to the bar until your chin is over the bar. Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position. 

 These are just a few examples of bodyweight exercises. There are many other bodyweight exercises that you can try. You can find more bodyweight exercises online and in fitness books and magazines.

 Weight Loss Exercises vs   Forms of Exercises 

 Exercise is essential for maintaining a healthy weight and overall well - being. However, there are many different types of exercise, and each type has its own unique benefits. When it comes to weight loss, some types of exercise are more effective than others. 

 Weight Loss Exercises 

 Weight loss exercises are those that burn a lot of calories and help to build muscle. Some examples of weight loss exercises include : 

     Cardio : Cardio exercises are those that get your heart rate up and your blood pumping. Examples of cardio exercises include running, swimming, biking, and dancing. 
     Strength training : Strength training exercises help to build and strengthen muscle. Examples of strength training exercises include lifting weights, bodyweight exercises, and resistance band exercises. 

   Forms of Exercise 

   forms of exercise can also be beneficial for weight loss, but they are not as effective as weight loss exercises. Some examples of other forms of exercise include : 

     Flexibility training : Flexibility training helps to improve your range of motion. Examples of flexibility training exercises include yoga, Pilates, and stretching. 
     Balance training : Balance training helps to improve your coordination and stability. Examples of balance training exercises include standing on one leg, walking on a balance beam, and using a BOSU ball. 

 Contrasting the Two 

 The main difference between weight loss exercises and other forms of exercise is that weight loss exercises are more effective for burning calories and building muscle. Cardio and strength training exercises are the best types of weight loss exercises because they burn a lot of calories and help to build muscle. Muscle mass helps to increase your metabolism, which means that you burn more calories even at rest. 

   forms of exercise, such as flexibility training and balance training, are still important for overall health and well - being, but they are not as effective for weight loss. However, they can be combined with weight loss exercises to create a more comprehensive fitness routine. 

 Which Type of Exercise is Best for You? 

 The best type of exercise for you depends on your individual goals and fitness level. If you are looking to lose weight, then weight loss exercises should be the focus of your fitness routine. However, it is important to include other forms of exercise as well to improve your overall health and well - being. 

 If you are new to exercise, it is a good idea to start with a combination of cardio and strength training exercises. You can gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts as you get fitter. It is also important to listen to your body and rest when needed. 

 Weight Loss Workouts vs   Forms of Exercise 

 When it comes to weight loss, there are two main types of exercise to consider : weight loss workouts and other forms of exercise. Weight loss workouts are specifically designed to burn calories and promote fat loss, while other forms of exercise can also have a positive impact on weight loss, but are not specifically designed for that purpose. 

 Weight Loss Workouts 

 Weight loss workouts typically involve high - intensity interval training ( HIIT ), which is a type of exercise that alternates between short bursts of intense activity and periods of rest or low - intensity activity. HIIT is very effective for burning calories and promoting fat loss, because it keeps your heart rate elevated and your metabolism boosted for a longer period of time after your workout. 

 Here is a general example of a weight loss workout : 

     Warm - up : 5 - 10 minutes of light cardio, such as jogging or jumping jacks 
     HIIT workout : 20 - 30 minutes of alternating between short bursts of intense activity ( e.g., sprinting, burpees, mountain climbers ) and periods of rest or low - intensity activity ( e.g., walking ) 
     Cool - down : 5 - 10 minutes of light cardio and stretching 

   Forms of Exercise 

   forms of exercise that can also have a positive impact on weight loss include : 

     Moderate - intensity cardio : This type of exercise is less intense than HIIT, but it can still be effective for burning calories and promoting fat loss. Examples of moderate - intensity cardio include running, biking, swimming, and dancing. 
     Strength training : Strength training helps to build muscle, which can boost your metabolism and help you burn more calories at rest. Examples of strength training exercises include lifting weights, using resistance bands, and doing bodyweight exercises such as push - ups and sit - ups. 

 How to Do Each Movement 

 When doing any type of exercise, it is important to use proper form to avoid injuries. Here are some general tips for doing each movement : 

     Speed and tempo : The speed and tempo of your movements will vary depending on the type of exercise you are doing. For example, HIIT workouts typically involve short bursts of very fast - paced activity, while moderate - intensity cardio and strength training workouts involve a slower, more controlled pace. 
     Rest and rep count : The amount of rest you take between sets and the number of repetitions you perform will also vary depending on the type of exercise you are doing. For HIIT workouts, you typically take very short breaks between sets ( e.g., 10 - 15 seconds ). For moderate - intensity cardio and strength training workouts, you typically take longer breaks between sets ( e.g., 30 - 60 seconds ). The number of repetitions you perform will also vary depending on the exercise and your fitness level. 

 Conclusion 

 Both weight loss workouts and other forms of exercise can help you lose weight. The best type of exercise for you will depend on your individual fitness level and goals. If you are looking to lose weight quickly, HIIT workouts may be a good option for you. If you are looking for a more sustainable approach to weight loss, you may want to consider a combination of moderate - intensity cardio and strength training. 

 No matter what type of exercise you choose, it is important to be consistent with your workouts and to listen to your body. If you are feeling any pain, stop the exercise and rest. 

 Weight Loss Workouts 

     Speed and tempo : Weight loss workouts typically involve a faster speed and tempo than other forms of exercise. This is because HIIT workouts are designed to get your heart rate up and your metabolism boosted quickly. 
     Rest and rep count : Weight loss workouts typically involve shorter rest periods between sets and higher rep counts. This is because HIIT workouts are designed to keep your heart rate elevated and your metabolism boosted for a longer period of time after your workout. 
     Examples : Some examples of weight loss workouts include : 
         HIIT workouts : Tabata sprints, burpees, mountain climbers, battle ropes 
         Circuit training : A series of exercises performed one after the other with little to no rest in between 
         Interval training : Alternating between periods of high - intensity and low - intensity exercise 
         Kickboxing : A combination of martial arts and boxing 

   Forms of Exercise 

     Speed and tempo :   forms of exercise, such as moderate - intensity cardio and strength training, typically involve a slower speed and tempo than weight loss workouts. This is because these types of workouts are not specifically designed to burn calories and promote fat loss, but they can still have a positive impact on weight loss. 
     Rest and rep count :   forms of exercise typically involve longer rest periods between sets and lower rep counts than weight loss workouts. This is because these types of workouts are designed to build muscle and endurance, which can also help you burn calories and lose weight. 
     Examples : Some examples of other forms of exercise include : 
         Moderate - intensity cardio : Running, biking, swimming, dancing, elliptical training 
         Strength training : Weightlifting, resistance band training, bodyweight exercises 
         Yoga : A mind - body practice that combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation 
         Pilates : A low - impact exercise that focuses on core strength and flexibility 

 Which Is Right for You? 

 The best type of exercise for you will depend on your individual fitness level, goals, and preferences. If you are new to exercise, it is important to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts over time. If you are unsure which type of exercise is right for you, it is a good idea to talk to a certified personal trainer. 

 Here are some general guidelines for choosing between weight loss workouts and other forms of exercise : 

     If you are looking to lose weight quickly, weight loss workouts may be a good option for you. However, it is important to note that HIIT workouts can be very challenging, so it is important to listen to your body and take breaks when needed. 
     If you are looking for a more sustainable approach to weight loss, you may want to consider a combination of moderate - intensity cardio and strength training. These types of workouts are less intense than HIIT workouts, but they can still be very effective for burning calories and promoting fat loss. 
     If you are new to exercise, it is a good idea to start with moderate - intensity cardio and strength training. Once you have built up your fitness level, you can gradually start to incorporate HIIT workouts into your routine. 

 No matter what type of exercise you choose, it is important to be consistent with your workouts and to listen to your body. If you are feeling any pain, stop the exercise and rest. 

 Weight Loss Workouts vs.   Forms of Exercise : A Contrast 

 Exercise is a key component of any fitness regimen, but not all workouts are created equal. Different forms of exercise serve different purposes, and understanding these differences can help you tailor your workout routine to your specific goals. In this essay, we will contrast weight loss workouts with other forms of exercise, focusing on the execution of each movement, including speed, tempo, rest, and rep count. 
 Weight Loss Workouts 

 Weight loss workouts are typically characterized by high - intensity, fast - paced exercises that aim to burn calories and fat. The goal is to elevate the heart rate and keep it elevated for extended periods, which increases the body is metabolic rate and leads to greater calorie burn. 

 Speed : Weight loss workouts often involve quick, explosive movements. The faster you move, the more calories you burn. 

 Tempo : The tempo of weight loss workouts is typically fast. This helps to keep the heart rate elevated and maintain a high level of intensity. 

 Rest : Rest periods in weight loss workouts are usually short, often ranging from 30 seconds to a minute. The goal is to keep the heart rate elevated and maintain the intensity of the workout. 

 Rep Count : Weight loss workouts often involve high rep counts. The idea is to perform as many reps as possible within a given time frame to maximize calorie burn. 
   Forms of Exercise 

   forms of exercise, such as strength training or flexibility exercises, have different goals and therefore different execution parameters. 

 Speed : In contrast to weight loss workouts, other forms of exercise often involve slower, more controlled movements. This allows for greater focus on form and muscle engagement. 

 Tempo : The tempo of these workouts is typically slower, allowing for a greater focus on muscle contraction and relaxation. 

 Rest : Rest periods in these workouts are often longer, ranging from one to three minutes. This allows the muscles to recover and prepare for the next set. 

 Rep Count : These workouts often involve lower rep counts, typically ranging from 5 to 15 reps per set. The focus is on quality of movement rather than quantity. 

 In conclusion, while all forms of exercise can contribute to overall fitness, the specific goals of a workout will dictate its execution. Weight loss workouts are characterized by high intensity, fast tempo, short rest periods, and high rep counts, designed to maximize calorie burn and promote weight loss.   forms of exercise, on the other hand, may prioritize muscle strength, endurance, or flexibility, and therefore involve slower, more controlled movements, longer rest periods, and lower rep counts. Understanding these differences can help you tailor your workout routine to your specific fitness goals. 


 Absolutely, I ’d be happy to delve deeper into this topic. 

 Weight Loss Workouts 

 Weight loss workouts are designed to burn calories and fat. They typically involve high - intensity exercises that elevate the heart rate and keep it elevated for extended periods. This increases the body is metabolic rate, leading to greater calorie burn.

     Upper body injuries : Lower body exercises, core exercises, stretching 
     Core injuries : Low - impact exercises, upper body exercises, stretching 

 Here is a sample workout routine for someone recovering from a lower body injury : 

     Warm - up : 5 - 10 minutes of light cardio, such as swimming or biking 
     Workout : 
         10 minutes of upper body exercises, such as push - ups, rows, and shoulder presses 
         10 minutes of core exercises, such as planks, crunches, and leg raises 
         20 minutes of low - impact cardio, such as swimming or biking 
     Cool - down : 5 - 10 minutes of stretching 

 Tips for Modifying Exercises 

 If you are unable to do a particular exercise due to an injury, there are often modifications that you can make. For example, if you have a knee injury, you can modify squats by doing them against a wall or with a chair. 

 Here are some other tips for modifying exercises : 

     Use lighter weights or resistance bands. This can reduce the stress on your joints and muscles. 
     Reduce the number of repetitions or sets. You can gradually increase the number of repetitions and sets as your injury heals. 
     Change the range of motion. For example, if you have a shoulder injury, you can modify bench presses by doing them with a shorter range of motion. 
     Use different equipment. For example, if you have a knee injury, you can use a stationary bike instead of a treadmill. 

 If you are unsure how to modify an exercise, talk to your doctor or physical therapist. They can help you create a safe and effective workout plan that is tailored to your specific needs. 

 Importance of Recovery 

 Recovery is just as important as exercise when you are recovering from an injury. It is important to give your body time to heal, so be sure to get enough sleep and eat a healthy diet. You may also want to consider using foam rolling and massage to help reduce muscle tension and promote healing. 

 When to Start Working Out Again 

 The amount of time it takes to heal from an injury varies depending on the severity of the injury. It is important to talk to your doctor or physical therapist before starting any new workout routine, even if you have recovered from your injury. 

 Here are some general guidelines for when to start working out again after an injury : 

     Lower body injuries : Most people can start working out again within 6 - 8 weeks of a lower body injury. However, it is important to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts over time. 
     Upper body injuries : Most people can start working out again within 4 - 6 weeks of an upper body injury. However, it is important to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts over time. 
     Core injuries : Most people can start working out again within 2 - 4 weeks of a core injury. However, it is important to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts over time. 

 It is important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard when you are first starting to work out again after an injury. If you are feeling any pain, stop the exercise and rest. 

 Conclusion 

 Working out with an injury can be challenging, but it is important to stay active to maintain your fitness and reduce the risk of re - injury. However, it is important to listen to your body and modify your workouts as needed. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist before starting any new workout routine and be sure to focus on low - impact exercises.

 Tips : 

     Build a strong aerobic base. This means doing regular cardio workouts that get your heart rate up and your blood pumping. Good examples of aerobic exercises include running, swimming, biking, and dancing. 
     Strength train regularly. Strength training helps to build muscle, which can improve your running economy and reduce your risk of injury. Good examples of strength training exercises include squats, lunges, deadlifts, push - ups, and pull - ups. 
     Eat a healthy diet. Eating a healthy diet will give you the energy you need to train hard and recover properly. Be sure to eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. 
     Get enough sleep. Sleep is essential for muscle recovery and overall health. Aim for 7 - 8 hours of sleep per night. 
     Listen to your body. If you are feeling pain, take a break. Do not push yourself too hard, especially when you are first starting out. 

 Incorporate HIIT ( high - intensity interval training ) into your routine. HIIT is a very effective way to improve cardiovascular fitness and endurance. HIIT workouts involve alternating between short bursts of intense activity and periods of rest or low - intensity activity. For example, you might sprint for 30 seconds, then walk for 60 seconds. Repeat this cycle for 10 - 15 minutes 

 Routines : 

 Here are some sample long - distance endurance training routines : 

 Beginner : 

     3 - 4 days per week of cardio workouts, each lasting 30 - 45 minutes. 
     1 - 2 days per week of strength training workouts, each lasting 20 - 30 minutes. 

 Intermediate : 

     4 - 5 days per week of cardio workouts, each lasting 45 - 60 minutes. 
     2 - 3 days per week of strength training workouts, each lasting 30 - 40 minutes. 

 Advanced : 

     5 - 6 days per week of cardio workouts, each lasting 60 - 90 minutes. 
     3 - 4 days per week of strength training workouts, each lasting 40 - 60 minutes. 

 You can adjust the number and duration of your workouts depending on your fitness level and goals. Be sure to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts over time. 

 Here is an example of a weekly long - distance endurance training routine for an intermediate runner : 

     Monday : Cardio workout ( e.g., 45 - minute run ) 
     Tuesday : Strength training workout ( e.g., squats, lunges, deadlifts, push - ups, and pull - ups ) 
     Wednesday : Cardio workout ( e.g., 60 - minute run ) 
     Thursday : Strength training workout ( e.g., core exercises ) 
     Friday : Cardio workout ( e.g., 45 - minute run ) 
     Saturday : Rest or cross - training ( e.g., yoga or swimming ) 
     Sunday : Long run ( e.g., 90 - minute run ) 

 You can adjust this routine to fit your own schedule and fitness level. For example, if you are new to running, you might want to start with shorter runs and gradually increase the distance each week. 

 It is also important to incorporate rest and recovery days into your training routine. Your muscles need time to repair and rebuild after hard workouts. Be sure to take at least one day off per week from running. 

 If you are serious about improving your long - distance endurance, it is a good idea to hire a running coach. A running coach can help you create a personalized training plan and help you stay on track with your goals. 

 Tapering 

 Tapering is the process of reducing the intensity and duration of your workouts in the week or two leading up to a race. Tapering helps your body to rest and recover so that you are fresh for the race. 

 Here are some tips for tapering : 

     Reduce the intensity of your workouts by 20 - 30 %. 
     Reduce the duration of your workouts by 10 - 20 %. 
     Get plenty of rest and sleep. 
     Eat a healthy diet. 

 By following these tips, you can improve your long - distance endurance and achieve your running goals. 

 Follow the 10- to 15 - Percent Rule 

 Many overuse injuries happen because runners increase mileage too quickly. New runners who ramp up volume too fast are especially vulnerable to injuries, because their bones, tendons, ligaments, and muscles have not yet been conditioned to withstand the impact of running. But even seasoned runners can get hurt from building too quickly. 

 “ I have seen runners who used to do 100 miles per week get hurt while they are only at 60 per week, because they built up incorrectly, ”. “ Just because you used to do a certain amount of miles does not mean you can pick up right where you left off. ” 

 That said, runners who have run higher mileage in the past can usually increase their mileage more rapidly than those who have not, since their bodies have already adapted to high - volume training at one time. 

 Regardless of your previous experience with mileage, all runners should follow the 10- to 15 - percent rule : Calculate what 10 to 15 percent of your goal weekly mileage is, then increase your mileage each week by no more than that amount. For example, if your goal is to run 60 miles per week, you should increase your mileage each week by no more than six to nine miles. If you usually run 10 miles per week, increase by no more than 1 to 1.5 miles the following week. 
 Build for Three Weeks, Rest for a Week 

 Another key to building mileage safely is to give your body a “ down week. ” In the same way that you should not run hard every day, you should not try to up your mileage every week. he recommends increasing mileage for three weeks, and then taking the fourth week “ down, ” by running a lower weekly mileage and more easier runs than the week before. 

 For example, if you aim to run 60 - mile weeks, you may run weeks of 40 miles, 46 miles, and 52 miles, and then drop back down to 46 miles in the fourth week. This relative resting period gives your legs time to absorb the mileage and build critical muscle memory before tacking on more miles. 

 “ Developing and maintaining consistency in your running is really important, ”  “ Any type of change on the body — including mileage — is really stressful, which is why so many injuries happen during buildup phases. Once your body is comfortable in a certain mileage, it is very easy to keep doing that week after week. ” 
 Increase Your Long Run Gradually, Too 

 Because many recreational runners who are training for marathons do the bulk of their weekly mileage in a weekly long run, it can be tempting to increase mileage by simply ramping up long runs. But this method can be especially hazardous, since extending time on your feet while you ’re already tired can result in sloppy form and leave you more prone to injuries. 

 he recommends that runners increase long runs by 10- to 15 - percent each week, with a down week every fourth week, in the same way that you increase your overall mileage. For the runner who is building to 60 - mile weeks with a peak long run of 20 miles, the four - week pattern could look like this : 

     40 miles ( 10 - mile long run ) 
     46 miles ( 12 - mile long run ) 
     52 miles ( 14 - mile long run ) 
     46 miles ( 12 - mile long run ) 

 Take It Easy 

 While you ’re building mileage, your focus should be on completing the distance, not hitting a certain pace. A common mistake runners make is increasing both volume and intensity at the same time, which can lead to overuse injuries or burnout. Speed work is especially ill - advised while running in the heat, because your body is already working harder to maintain a given pace. Leave intervals for later this year, when the weather is cooler and you ’re preparing to race again. 
 Prioritize Fueling and Recovery 

 Hands down, the best way to successfully build mileage is to recover well. “ In my experience, runners usually are not overtrained, but under - recovered. A lot of runners blame their failure on being overtrained when really they just had a bad day, ”  

 While most runners think of recovery as what immediately happens after a workout — cooling down, stretching, and foam rolling — it involves much more than that. Getting a proper amount of sleep, eating the right foods and enough of them, strength training regularly, practicing mindfulness, and eliminating extra stress are all necessary components of recovery. 

 Sleep and fueling enormously impact athletes ’ training performance,  Runners often misinterpret signs of sleep deprivation as training fatigue, which can lead to running less when you really just need more sleep.  

 “ They ’re getting around 8.5 hours of sleep per night, which is more than they have in 10 years, ” And it is paid off in practice : “ Their fitness levels are great, even though the training environment is not optimal. ” 

 fueling properly is important for any training cycle, but it is especially critical when you ’re increasing mileage, because you have to consume more calories to keep up with the extra energy you ’re burning each week. Keep in mind that while counting calories can be helpful in ensuring you get enough food, you should not stress about it. 

 For runners, eating more — especially whole grains, produce, and healthy proteins and fats — is always better than eating less, because it ensures that your body has plenty of energy and nutrients to rebuild bones and muscles. And do not be surprised if you gain a little weight when you ’re building mileage.  he said that he often gains a few pounds during a buildup, but once his body becomes comfortable with the mileage, his normal appetite returns again, and he sheds the extra pounds. 
 Look Out for Injury Warning Signs 

 Even if you do everything right while building mileage, injuries sometimes happen. That is just the nature of our high - impact sport. While overtraining is unlikely to happen if you increase volume slowly and prioritize recovery, if you feel extremely fatigued while running for seven days in a row, you should probably take a few days off. 

 Continuing to run on exhausted or achy legs can make you more at risk for developing overuse injuries. If you do develop an injury that changes the way you run and alters your gait mechanics, you should have it checked out by a doctor. 

 Long - Distance Running Planning Tips 

     For beginning runners, your mileage can increase by 20 - 25 % each week. So, if you ’re running three or four miles on your long run, you can safely add a mile or so each week to that run. 
     For more experienced runners aim to increase by no more 10 - 15 % each week. This is especially important once your long run distance is upwards of 10 miles or so,   These limits will help keep running injuries from overtraining at bay, as well as leave you time to have a life outside of training. 
     The rest of your weekly mileage will happen throughout the week in the form of speed work and easy runs. You will also need to allot time to mobility work. Do not be intimidated if that sounds like a lot of training to fit into one week. There are more details to come ! 
     Every 4th week, decrease the volume of your long run. This provides ample recovery for your body. It might seem counter - intuitive to reduce your training volume and run length, but there is a reason for it. 

 That “ deload ” week provides not only a mental break but also a physical one. You will have a little more time in your schedule to get in other priorities besides training. This will be especially apparent on your long run day, where the week before you may have run 12 miles, but now you ’re down to 7. 

 Enjoy the extra time and try not to stress that you ’re losing fitness. Your muscles are busy repairing the damage of training so that you can start the following week rested and ready to tackle your goal of longer distances. 
 2. Keep Your Training Schedule Balanced 

 Ever go for an epic long run on the weekend, only to then spend 6 days recovering from it? I ’m sure we have all been guilty of this at some point. There is even the term “ weekend warrior ” to describe this unbalanced way of training. 

 Instead, we want to balance our long runs with our shorter runs so that we ’re always making progress. 

 In fact, your long run distance should only make up about 30 % of your weekly mileage. On that long run, be sure to control the intensity. It should be a conversational pace throughout. So if you ’re gasping for breath while telling your running buddy what you did after work yesterday, you ’re running too fast. 

 Slow it down so you remain in control of your breath. It will pay off as you ’re able to run more easily without getting tired. 

 A good exercise we like to use here at The Run Experience – take 10 nose breaths every 10 - 15 minutes while on your run. If you ’re unable to do that at any point, you may want to slow your pace down a bit. No running buddy needed ! 

 For the other 70 % of your weekly mileage, here is what it might look like : 

     Try to get in one type of speed work per week, either a tempo, fartlek, or interval - style run 
     An easy recovery run ( think of an effort of 4 - 5 out of 10 ) is also appropriate after your speed work, or after your long run day 
     Hill workouts can also be a fun way to format your run 

  

 Repeat 6 - 8 times. 

     Run a quarter - mile fast. 

     Rest with easy jog for the time it took to run a quarter - mile. 

 The goal is to complete these runs as fast as you can. 

 Repeat 3 - 4 times. 

     Run a half - mile fast. 

     Rest with an easy jog for the time it takes to run a half - mile. 

 The other type of running you should focus on is an easy, paced run 2 - 3 times a week to learn how to run at your pace for the goal distance of your test. These other runs can be intervals like those above, just at your goal mile pace or longer, or slower distances with different sections of goal paced running measured. Check out this article on goal pace running. 

 All of the running workouts are great for getting you into well above passing / maxing conditioning for any military timed run event. So if you build your cardio conditioning ( VO2 max ), using both high - speed interval training and goal pace running distances, your 1.5-, two- and three - mile timed military runs will get better. 

 How to improve cardiovascular endurance 

 You can improve your cardiovascular endurance by doing activities that increase the amount of oxygen you breathe in. You can start with 10 to 15 minutes of cardiovascular endurance exercises a day. Then you can challenge your body a little at a time by adding a few minutes each day. ( Adults should get at least 150 minutes of exercise every week. ) 

 In addition to adding more minutes, you can increase how far you walk or make it harder by raising the incline on your treadmill. All of these push your body harder and improve your cardiovascular endurance. 

 A study of children in elementary school found that they increased their cardiovascular endurance after they went to physical education class four times a week instead of twice a week. 
 Sprint interval training ( SIT ) 

 Multiple studies found people improved their cardiovascular endurance by 4 % to 13.5 % after two to eight weeks of sprint exercises. Three times a week, they pushed their hardest for 10 to 30 seconds at a time. They repeated this three to seven times with two to five minutes to recover between sprints. 
 High - intensity interval training ( HIIT ) 

 This type of exercise adds brief times of high - intensity activity between periods of lower - intensity activity. A study found that HIIT improved people is cardiovascular endurance by 38 % to 79 %. 
 What are cardiovascular endurance exercises? 

 Exercises that improve your cardiovascular endurance make you breathe in more oxygen and make your heart rate go up. Examples of cardiovascular endurance activities include : 

     Swimming. 
     Riding a bike. 
     Dancing. 
     Jogging. 
     Walking. 
     Jumping rope. 
     Climbing stairs. 

 A note from Cleveland Clinic 

 No matter what age you are, you can improve your cardiovascular endurance. Ask a healthcare provider to help you make a plan to boost your cardiovascular endurance. You will feel better and have an easier time with everyday tasks. Start slowly and stick with it to see the best results.

 Flexibility 

 Flexibility is the range of motion that you have in your joints. It is important to have good flexibility to prevent injuries and improve your athletic performance. Flexibility workouts can also help to reduce muscle tension and improve your overall well - being. 

 There are two main types of flexibility workouts : static and dynamic. Static flexibility workouts involve holding a stretch for a period of time, typically 15 - 30 seconds. Dynamic flexibility workouts involve moving your body through a range of motion. 

 Here are some examples of static and dynamic flexibility exercises : 

 Static : 

     Hamstring stretch : Sit on the ground with your legs extended in front of you. Reach towards your toes, keeping your back straight. Hold for 15 - 30 seconds. 
     Quadriceps stretch : Stand facing a wall and place your hands on the wall at shoulder height. Step one leg back and bend your knee until your thigh is parallel to the ground. Hold for 15 - 30 seconds. 
     Calf stretch : Stand facing a wall and place your hands on the wall at shoulder height. Step one leg back and keep your heel on the ground. Lean forward until you feel a stretch in your calf. Hold for 15 - 30 seconds. 

 Dynamic : 

     Leg swings : Stand with your feet shoulder - width apart and swing one leg forward and back. Gradually increase the height of your swings. 
     Arm circles : Stand with your arms at your sides and make small circles with your arms. Gradually increase the size of your circles. 
     Torso twists : Stand with your feet shoulder - width apart and place your hands on your hips. Twist your torso to the right and then to the left. Gradually increase the range of your twists. 

 Balance 

 Balance is the ability to maintain your equilibrium. It is important to have good balance to prevent falls and injuries. Balance workouts can also help to improve your athletic performance and coordination. 

 Here are some examples of balance exercises : 

     Single leg stand : Stand on one leg for 10 - 30 seconds. Repeat on the other side. 
     Heel - to - toe walk : Walk heel - to - toe for 10 - 20 steps. Repeat in the opposite direction. 
     Tightrope walk : Walk on a raised surface or tightrope for 10 - 20 steps. 

 Agility 

 Agility is the ability to change direction quickly and efficiently. It is an important skill for many sports and activities. Agility workouts can help to improve your athletic performance, reduce your risk of injuries, and improve your overall fitness. 

 Here are some examples of agility exercises : 

     Ladder drills : Place a speed ladder on the ground and step through the rungs with your feet as quickly as possible. 
     Cone drills : Place cones on the ground in a zig - zag pattern and run around the cones as quickly as possible. 
     Shuttle runs : Run 10 - 20 yards in one direction and then back in the other direction. 

 You can incorporate flexibility, balance, and agility exercises into your regular workouts or do them as a separate workout. It is important to warm up before doing any flexibility, balance, or agility exercises. You should also cool down afterwards. 

 Here is a sample workout that you can try : 

 Warm - up 

     5 minutes of light cardio, such as jogging or jumping jacks 
     5 minutes of dynamic stretches, such as leg swings, arm circles, and torso twists 

 Workout 

     10 minutes of static stretches 
     10 minutes of balance exercises 
     10 minutes of agility exercises 

 Cool - down 

     5 minutes of light cardio 
     5 minutes of static stretches 

 You can adjust the duration and intensity of the workout to fit your fitness level and goals. Be sure to listen to your body and take breaks when needed. 

 Sure, here are some tips on how to work out effectively for flexibility, balance, and agility : 

 Flexibility : 

     Flexibility is the ability of your muscles and other connective tissues to stretch temporarily. 
     To increase your overall flexibility, it is best to incorporate a combination of breath work, static stretching, and dynamic stretching. 
     Adding strength training can further improve both your flexibility and mobility. 
     Even 10 minutes a few times a week can make a difference. 
     Examples of flexibility activities include : stretching, yoga, tai chi, pilates. 

 Balance : 

     Agility training improves a range of physical performance metrics including balance. 
     Among older adults, agility - based programs were at least as effective as traditional balance and strength training at improving balance and endurance. 

 Agility : 

     Agility is the general ability to change direction when moving quickly and efficiently, all while maintaining proper posture and movement mechanics. 
     Good agility requires the ability to safely decelerate, reorient, and reaccelerate in as little time as possible. 
     Agility training involves a range of exercises designed to improve your ability to change directions during movement. 
     Agility drills can help athletes improve coordination, speed, power, and reflexes. 

 Remember, it is always important to warm up before starting your workout and cool down afterwards. And do not forget to stay hydrated ! 

 Sure, here are some more tips : 

 Flexibility : 

     Yoga is a great way to work on your flexibility and strength. Just about everyone can do it, too – it is not just for people who can touch their toes or want to meditate. 
     Some types of yoga are about relaxation. In others, you move more. Most types focus on learning poses, called asanas. They also usually include attention to breathing. 

 Balance : 

     Tai Chi is an ancient Chinese tradition that, today, is practiced as a graceful form of exercise. It involves a series of movements performed in a slow, focused manner and accompanied by deep breathing. 
     Tai Chi is low impact and puts minimal stress on muscles and joints, making it generally safe for all ages and fitness levels. In fact, because Tai Chi is a low - impact exercise, it may be especially suitable if you ’re an older adult who otherwise may not exercise. 

 Agility : 

     Plyometric exercises are a sure - fire way to torch fat fast. This routine combines some of the best jumping moves you can do for a killer cardio session. 
     Do the full circuit below as quickly as possible ( you may even finish in less than 30 minutes ! ) anytime, anywhere. 
     Step forward with the right foot into a lunge, bending both knees to 90 degrees. 
     Jump straight up as high as possible, driving the knees into the chest. 
     Land softly and immediately lower into your next squat. 

 Remember, consistency is key in seeing results. Aim to include these exercises in your workouts regularly to improve your flexibility, balance, and agility. Always listen to your body and modify as needed. Happy exercising ! 

 To work out effectively for flexibility, balance, and agility, you need to incorporate a variety of exercises into your routine. Here are some tips : 

 Flexibility 

     Stretch regularly. Aim to stretch for at least 10 minutes, two to three times per week. 
     Hold each stretch for 30 - 60 seconds. 
     Focus on stretching all of the major muscle groups, including your hamstrings, quadriceps, calves, hip flexors, chest, shoulders, and back. 
     Breathe deeply and evenly while stretching. 

 Here are some examples of flexibility exercises : 

     Hamstring stretch : Sit on the ground with your legs extended in front of you. Bend forward at the waist, reaching towards your toes. 
     Quadriceps stretch : Stand facing a wall with your hands on the wall at shoulder height. Step one leg back and bend your front knee until your thigh is parallel to the ground. Keep your back heel raised. 
     Calf stretch : Stand facing a wall with your hands on the wall at shoulder height. Place one leg in front of the other and bend your front knee. Keep your back heel on the ground and lean forward until you feel a stretch in your back calf. 
     Hip flexor stretch : Kneel on one knee with your other foot in front of you. Keep your back straight and lean forward until you feel a stretch in your front hip flexor. 
     Chest stretch : Stand in a doorway with your hands on either side of the doorframe at shoulder height. Lean forward until you feel a stretch in your chest. 
     Shoulder stretch : Stand with your arms at your sides. Reach your right arm across your body and place your right hand on your left bicep. Gently pull your right arm towards your chest using your left hand. Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side. 
     Back stretch : Stand with your feet shoulder - width apart and bend forward at the waist. Keep your back straight and reach towards your toes. 

 Balance 

     Balance exercises help to improve your proprioception, which is your body is awareness of its position in space. 
     Aim to do balance exercises two to three times per week. 
     Start with simple exercises and gradually progress to more challenging ones. 

 Here are some examples of balance exercises : 

     Single - leg stand : Stand on one leg for 30 - 60 seconds. Repeat on the other side. 
     Heel - toe walk : Walk heel - to - toe for a short distance. 
     Tandem walk : Walk with one foot in front of the other, placing your heel on the toes of the foot in front of you. 
     Balance board : Stand on a balance board and try to keep your balance. 
     BOSU ball : Stand on a BOSU ball and try to perform various exercises, such as squats, lunges, and push - ups. 

 Agility 

     Agility exercises help you to move quickly and efficiently in different directions. 
     Aim to do agility exercises two to three times per week. 
     Start with simple exercises and gradually progress to more challenging ones. 

 Here are some examples of agility exercises : 

     Ladder drills : Move through an agility ladder in different patterns. 
     Cone drills : Run around cones in different patterns. 
     Shuttle runs : Sprint back and forth between two points. 
     Carioca : Run sideways, crossing one leg in front of the other. 
     Box jumps : Jump onto a box and then jump back down. 

 You can combine flexibility, balance, and agility exercises into a single workout. For example, you could start with a warm - up of dynamic stretches, such as arm circles and leg swings. Then, you could do a circuit of balance and agility exercises, such as single - leg stands, ladder drills, and cone drills. Finally, you could cool down with some static stretches. 

 It is important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. If you feel any pain, stop the exercise immediately. 

         Planks 

     Incorporate dynamic stretches into your warm - up. Dynamic stretches help to prepare your body for exercise by increasing your heart rate and range of motion. Some examples of dynamic stretches include : 
         Arm circles 
         Leg swings 
         High knees 
         Butt kicks 
         Walking lunges 

     Do balance exercises on unstable surfaces. This will make your balance exercises more challenging and help you to improve your proprioception. Some examples of unstable surfaces include : 
         BOSU ball 
         Balance board 
         Foam roller 
         Sand 

     Use plyometric exercises to improve your agility. Plyometric exercises are explosive movements that help to improve your power and speed. Some examples of plyometric exercises include : 
         Box jumps 
         Burpees 
         Clap push - ups 
         Tuck jumps 
         Lateral jumps 

     Cool down with static stretches. Static stretches help to improve your flexibility by lengthening your muscles. Some examples of static stretches include : 
         Hamstring stretch 
         Quadriceps stretch 
         Calf stretch 
         Hip flexor stretch 
         Chest stretch 
         Shoulder stretch 
         Back stretch 

 Here is a sample workout that you can try : 

 Warm - up 

     5 minutes of light cardio, such as jogging or jumping jacks 
     5 minutes of dynamic stretches, such as arm circles and leg swings 

 Workout 

     Squats : 3 sets of 10 - 12 repetitions 
     Lunges : 3 sets of 10 - 12 repetitions per leg 
     Deadlifts : 3 sets of 5 - 8 repetitions 
     Push - ups : 3 sets to failure 
     Pull - ups : 3 sets to failure 
     Planks : 3 sets of 30 - 60 seconds 

 Cool - down 

     5 minutes of light cardio 
     5 minutes of static stretches 

 You can adjust the number of sets and repetitions depending on your fitness level. You can also add or remove exercises as needed. Be sure to listen to your body and rest when you need to. 

 Flexibility : 

     Flexibility can seem like something you ’re either born with or not. However, it is possible to improve your flexibility — even if you have not touched your toes in years ( or ever). 
     Flexibility means the muscles and joints in your body can move without restriction or pain. 
     Flexibility is important for everyday life. Think about bending over to pick up the laundry or reaching for something high on a shelf. If your muscles are inelastic, tasks like these will be much more complicated. 
     Flexibility is also needed to release muscle tension and soreness as well as to promote relaxation. 

 Balance : 

     Building your glutes, quads, and hamstrings can help with your balance. Strong legs can help improve your balance and prevent falls. 
     Squats are a super effective and super simple way to strengthen your legs. 

 Agility : 

     Agility is the general ability to change direction when moving quickly and efficiently, all while maintaining proper posture and movement mechanics. 
     Good agility requires the ability to safely decelerate, reorient, and reaccelerate in as little time as possible. 
     Agility training involves a range of exercises designed to improve your ability to change directions during movement. 
     Agility drills can help athletes improve coordination, speed, power, and reflexes. 

 Remember, it is always important to warm up before starting your workout and cool down afterwards. And do not forget to stay hydrated !

 Flexibility : 

     Flexibility is the ability of your muscles and other connective tissues to stretch temporarily. 
     If you ’re looking to increase your overall flexibility, it is best to incorporate a combination of breath work, static stretching, and dynamic stretching. 
     Adding strength training can further improve both your flexibility and mobility. 
     This may seem like a big time commitment, but even 10 minutes a few times a week can make a difference. 

 Balance : 

     A recumbent bike or stair stepper is a safe way to start if your balance needs a lot of work. 
     Stretching loosens tight muscles, which can affect posture and balance. 
     Yoga strengthens and stretches tight muscles while challenging your static and dynamic balance skills. 

 Agility :

 The main differences between a novice and expert workout plan are intensity, reps, and weight. The exercises themselves are often the same, but the way they are performed is different. 

 Novice workout plan 

     Lower intensity 
     More reps ( 12 - 15 ) 
     Lighter weights 
     Focus on learning proper form 

 Expert workout plan 

     Higher intensity 
     Fewer reps ( 5 - 8) 
     Heavier weights 
     Focus on progressive overload 

 Novice workout plans are designed to help beginners learn proper form and avoid injury. Expert workout plans are designed to help experienced lifters achieve their fitness goals, such as building muscle or strength. 

 Here is an example of a novice workout plan for squats : 

     3 sets of 12 - 15 repetitions 
     Use a weight that is challenging but allows you to maintain good form 

 Here is an example of an expert workout plan for squats : 

     3 sets of 5 - 8 repetitions 
     Use a weight that is challenging and forces you to push yourself to failure 

 As you can see, the exercises are the same, but the intensity and weight are different. The novice workout plan uses a lighter weight and more reps, while the expert workout plan uses a heavier weight and fewer reps. 

 It is important to note that this is just a general overview of the difference between novice and expert workout plans. There is no one - size - fits - all approach, and the best workout plan for you will depend on your individual needs and goals. It is always a good idea to consult with a qualified personal trainer to develop a workout plan that is right for you. 


 Here are some other differences between novice and expert workout plans : 

   
     Volume : Novices typically perform 1 - 2 sets of each exercise, while experts may perform 3 - 5 sets of each exercise. 
     Progression : Novices should focus on increasing the weight they lift and the number of reps they perform gradually. Experts may use more advanced progression schemes, such as periodization. 
     Specificity : Novices should focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at the same time. Experts may focus on more isolation exercises to target specific muscle groups. 




   





 Tips for working out 7 days a week without rest days 

     Listen to your body : If you are feeling tired, fatigued, or sore, take a rest day. 
     Focus on active recovery : On days when you are not lifting weights, focus on active recovery activities such as yoga, swimming, or walking. 
     Prioritize sleep : Getting enough sleep is essential for recovery. Aim for 7 - 8 hours of sleep per night. 
     Eat a healthy diet : A healthy diet will provide your body with the nutrients it needs to recover from your workouts. 
     Use lighter weights and lower reps : Working out 7 days a week may require you to reduce the weights you are lifting and the number of repetitions you are doing. 
     Focus on different muscle groups each day : This will help to prevent overtraining any one muscle group. 
     Vary your workouts : Doing the same workout every day can lead to boredom and plateaus. Mix up your workouts to keep your body challenged. 

 1. One - Day - A - Week Workout :* This type of workout is ideal for individuals who have busy schedules or prefer to concentrate their workout efforts into a single day. * Since you only have one day to work out, it is important to make the most of it. Focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, such as squats, deadlifts, bench press, rows, and shoulder press. These exercises will help you build strength and muscle mass efficiently. * To maximize your time, consider circuit training or high - intensity interval training ( HIIT ). These methods involve alternating between different exercises with minimal rest periods in between. This will not only save time but also boost your cardiovascular endurance and increase calorie burn. * As you 're only working out once a week, it is crucial to ensure proper recovery. Make sure to stretch after your workout, and take rest days as needed. Adequate recovery allows your muscles to repair and grow, which is essential for progress.2. 7 - Days - A - Week Workout :* This type of workout is suitable for individuals who want to maintain a consistent fitness routine and split their workouts into manageable chunks. * With seven days to work with, you can spread out your workouts by muscle group or focus on specific exercises each day. For example, Monday could be dedicated to upper body, Tuesday for lower body, Wednesday for core and abs, Thursday for upper body again, Friday for lower body, Saturday for active recovery or rest, and Sunday for total body or a day off. * Since you 're working out more frequently, you do not need to cram all your exercise into one day. Focus on moderate weights, controlled movements, and proper form. Your goal should be to stimulate muscle growth and improve overall fitness without overexerting yourself. * To avoid plateaus and prevent overtraining, mix up your workouts by varying the intensity, volume, and exercises. You can also incorporate different types of physical activity, such as yoga, Pilates, swimming, or cycling, to supplement your strength training. 

 1. Intensity : 	 * One - day - a - week workout : Since you only have one day to work out, you may want to make the most of it by pushing yourself harder and increasing the intensity. This can be beneficial for building strength and muscle mass, but also increases the risk of injury if not done properly. 	 * 7 - days - a - week workout : With more frequent workouts, you may not need to push yourself as hard each day. Instead, focus on maintaining proper form and control throughout each exercise. This approach can help you build endurance and consistency, while reducing the risk of overexertion.2. Volume : 	 * One - day - a - week workout : To maximize your single workout day, you may want to increase the volume by adding more sets, reps, or exercises. However, be cautious not to overdo it, as excessive volume can lead to fatigue, muscle soreness, and potentially injury. 	 * 7 - days - a - week workout : With multiple workouts per week, you can spread out the volume across different days. For example, you could do 3 sets of 10 reps on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, instead of cramming all 9 sets into a single day. This approach can help keep your workouts manageable while still promoting progress.3. Muscle groups : 	 * One - day - a - week workout : When you only have one day to work out, it is essential to prioritize the muscle groups you want to target. Focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, such as squats, deadlifts, bench press, rows, and shoulder press. 	 * 7 - days - a - week workout : With more frequent workouts, you can dedicate specific days to different muscle groups. For instance, Monday could be chest and triceps, Tuesday for back and biceps, Thursday for legs, and Friday for shoulders and abs. This approach allows for a more focused workout and can help prevent muscle imbalances.4. Rest and recovery : 	 * One - day - a - week workout : Since you only work out once a week, make sure to allow adequate time for rest and recovery between sessions. Aim for at least 2 - 3 rest days per week, and take additional days off as needed. Proper rest helps your muscles repair and grow, which is crucial for progress. 	 * 7 - days - a - week workout : With more frequent workouts, you may not need as much rest time between sessions. However, it is still important to listen to your body and adjust your workout schedule accordingly. If you feel fatigued or sore, take an extra day off or reduce the intensity of your workouts.5. Consistency : 	 * One - day - a - week workout : To see consistent progress, it is essential to maintain a regular workout routine. Try to schedule your workout at the same time each week, and make sure to prioritize it in your daily planner. Consistency is key to achieving your fitness goals. 	 * 7 - days - a - week workout : While consistency is important, it is also crucial to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. If you find that you 're consistently feeling fatigued or sore, consider doing some lighter days to   allow for recovery. 8. Incorporate active recovery days : Active recovery days involve engaging in light physical activity, such as yoga, Pilates, or a leisurely walk, to help your body recover from the previous day is workout. This can help promote blood flow, reduce muscle soreness, and improve flexibility.   Vary your workouts : To avoid plateaus and prevent overtraining, mix up your workouts by varying the intensity, volume, and exercises. You can also incorporate different types of physical activity, such as swimming, cycling, or rowing, to supplement your strength training. 

 Differentiating a workout that is only one day a week as opposed to 7 days a week can be achieved through various strategies and techniques. Here are some general tips and advice to consider : 

     Intensity : A one - day - a - week workout should be more intense than a 7 - day - a - week workout. Since you have only one day to exercise, you need to make the most of it. Increase the intensity by adding more weight, doing more reps, or reducing the rest time between sets. 
     Total body vs. isolated exercises : A one - day - a - week workout should focus on total body exercises, such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and pull - ups. These exercises engage multiple muscle groups at once, ensuring that you get a full - body workout in a shorter amount of time. In contrast, a 7 - day - a - week workout can include a mix of total body and isolated exercises, targeting specific muscle groups on different days. 
     Weight training vs. cardio : A one - day - a - week workout should prioritize weight training over cardio. Weight training builds muscle and strength, which can help improve your metabolism and burn more calories throughout the day. However, it is still important to incorporate some cardio into your routine to improve heart health and burn fat. A 7 - day - a - week workout can include a more balanced mix of weight training and cardio, with different types of cardio activities on different days ( e.g., running, swimming, cycling ). 

 Differentiating a one - day - a - week workout from a 7 - day - a - week workout can be done by considering the following factors : 

     Intensity : A one - day - a - week workout can be more intense since the individual has more time to recover between workouts. In contrast, a 7 - day - a - week workout may need to be less intense to allow for adequate recovery time. 
     Volume : A one - day - a - week workout can involve a higher volume of exercise, such as more sets and reps, since the individual has more time to recover. In contrast, a 7 - day - a - week workout may need to have lower volume to avoid overtraining. 
     Muscle groups : A one - day - a - week workout can focus on a total - body workout or a single muscle group, while a 7 - day - a - week workout can target different muscle groups on different days. 
	 Rest and recovery : Rest and recovery are crucial for muscle growth and repair. A one - day - a - week workout allows for more time for rest and recovery between workouts, while a 7 - day - a - week workout may require more frequent rest days or lighter workouts to allow for adequate recovery. 



 You ’re correct in your thinking. The approach to a one - day - a - week workout versus a seven - day - a - week workout would indeed be different. Here are some general tips : 

 One - Day - a - Week Workout : 

     Intensity : Since you only have one day to exercise, it is important to make the most of it. This means your workout should be as intense as you can safely manage. 
     Total Body : A full - body workout is a good idea, as it allows you to target all major muscle groups in one session. This could include a mix of cardio, strength training, and flexibility exercises. 
     Rest : Remember, your body needs time to recover after an intense workout, so ensure you ’re getting adequate rest and nutrition throughout the week. 

 Seven - Days - a - Week Workout : 

     Variety : With seven days to work with, you can afford to vary your workouts. This could mean focusing on different muscle groups each day, or alternating between types of exercise ( e.g., cardio, strength training, flexibility ). 
     Intensity : The intensity of each workout can be lower than in a one - day - a - week routine, as you ’re spreading your activity out over the week. However, it is still important to challenge yourself. 
     Rest : Even though you ’re working out every day, rest is still crucial. Consider incorporating active rest days, where you do light activities like walking or yoga. 

 Remember, it is important to listen to your body and adjust your workout routine as needed. It is also a good idea to consult with a fitness professional to ensure your workout plan is safe and effective for your individual needs and goals. 

 Sure, here is some general advice and tips on how to differentiate workouts based on frequency : 

 One day a week : 

     Focus on total body exercises : Since you 're only working out once a week, it is important to make sure you 're hitting all major muscle groups. This could include a combination of compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, presses, and rows, as well as isolation exercises for smaller muscles. 

     Keep the intensity high : Since you 're only working out once a week, you can afford to push yourself harder during each workout. This could mean using heavier weights, doing more reps, or taking shorter rest periods. 

     Consider using a whole - body circuit training approach : This type of training involves moving from one exercise to another with little or no rest in between. This is a great way to get a lot of work done in a short amount of time. 

 Three to four days a week : 

     Split your workouts into upper body and lower body : This will allow you to focus on specific muscle groups on different days, which can help you recover more effectively. 

     Use a moderate intensity level : Aim to work out hard enough to get a good workout, but not so hard that you 're overtraining. 

     Incorporate a variety of exercises : Include a mix of compound and isolation exercises, as well as cardio and strength training. 

 Seven days a week : 

     Spread out your workouts to focus on different muscle groups on different days : This will help you avoid overtraining and allow your muscles to recover properly. 

     Use a variety of intensities : Mix up your workouts with some days being more intense than others. This will help you keep your body challenged and prevent boredom. 

     Incorporate active recovery days : On your rest days, do some light activity like yoga, swimming, or walking. This will help you stay active while giving your body time to recover. 

 Here are some additional tips for differentiating workouts based on frequency : 

     Consider your fitness level : If you 're a beginner, you may want to start with 1 - 2 days a week and gradually increase the frequency as you get stronger. 

     Listen to your body : If you 're feeling sore or tired, take a rest day or two. It is better to miss a workout than to overdo it and risk injury. 

     Track your progress : Keeping track of your workouts can help you see how you 're progressing and make adjustments to your routine as needed. 

     Find an activity you enjoy : If you do not enjoy your workouts, you 're less likely to stick with them. Find an activity that you find challenging and fun. 

     Make it a habit : Schedule your workouts into your day and stick to your schedule as much as possible. The more you make it a habit, the easier it will become to stick with it. 

 Remember, the best workout frequency for you will depend on your individual needs and goals. Experiment with different frequencies and intensities to find what works best for you. 

 Differentiating workouts based on the frequency of exercise can be achieved through various strategies, including adjusting the intensity, duration, and focus of the workouts. Here are some general tips and advice for creating workouts based on different frequencies : 

     One day a week workout : 
         Since you are only exercising once a week, it is essential to make the most of this session. Aim for a high - intensity, total - body workout that targets all major muscle groups. 
         Incorporate compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and pull - ups. 
         Keep the duration of the workout relatively short ( 30 - 45 minutes ) to avoid overtraining and ensure proper recovery. 
         Focus on quality over quantity, and maintain good form throughout the workout. 
     3 - 4 days a week workout : 
         With a slightly higher frequency of exercise, you can afford to have a more balanced approach to your workouts. 
         Incorporate a mix of compound and isolation exercises to target specific muscle groups. 
         Vary the intensity and duration of your workouts based on your goals and fitness level. 
         Consider incorporating active rest days, where you engage in light physical activities like walking or swimming, to aid in recovery and maintain a healthy lifestyle. 
     7 days a week workout : 
         With a daily workout routine, it is crucial to keep the intensity and duration of each session relatively low to avoid overtraining and burnout. 
         Focus on consistency and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, rather than pushing yourself to the limit every day. 
         Incorporate a mix of different types of exercise, such as cardio, strength training, and flexibility work, to create a well - rounded routine. 
         Listen to your body and adjust the intensity and duration of your workouts as needed. 

 Remember that these are general guidelines, and individual needs and goals may vary. Always consult with a healthcare professional or a personal trainer to create a workout plan that is tailored to your specific needs and goals. 



 When it comes to structuring a workout routine, the frequency and intensity of your workouts can vary greatly depending on your fitness goals, current fitness level, and available time. Here are some general tips for different workout frequencies : 

 One day a week : If you ’re only working out one day a week, it is important to make the most of that workout. You might want to consider a full - body workout that targets all the major muscle groups. This could include a mix of cardio, strength training, and flexibility exercises. The intensity should be moderate to high, but always within your capabilities and comfort level. Remember, it is important to warm up before starting your workout and cool down afterwards. 

 Three to four days a week : If you ’re working out three to four days a week, you have more flexibility in your routine. You could consider splitting your workouts into different types of training on different days. For example, you could do strength training on one day, cardio on another, and flexibility or balance exercises on another. This allows each muscle group to rest and recover on the off days, which is crucial for muscle growth and preventing injury. 

 Seven days a week : If you ’re working out every day, it is especially important to listen to your body and avoid overtraining. Consider varying the intensity of your workouts throughout the week, with some days being more intense than others. You could also focus on different muscle groups each day to allow for adequate rest and recovery. For example, you might have a leg day, an arm day, a core day, etc. Remember, rest is just as important as exercise for overall health and fitness, so consider incorporating active rest days where you do light activities like walking or stretching.

 When designing a 15 - minute workout, it is important to focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once. This will help you get the most out of your time and maximize your calorie burn. A good example of a 15 - minute workout would be : 

     5 minutes of cardio, such as running, jumping jacks, or biking 
     10 minutes of strength training, such as squats, lunges, and push - ups 

 If you have over an hour, you can add more exercises to your workout and focus on more specific muscle groups. You can also increase the intensity of your workout by doing more reps or sets of each exercise. This will help you build more muscle and burn more calories. 

 Here is an example of an hour - long workout : 

     10 minutes of cardio, such as running, jumping jacks, or biking

 When designing a workout with limited time, it is important to prioritize the most effective exercises and optimize the workout to maximize the time available. Here are some tips for designing a 15 - minute workout and a 60 - minute workout : 

 15 - Minute Workout : 

 1. Warm - up : Start with a 2 - 3 minute dynamic warm - up, such as jumping jacks, jogging in place, or high knees. This will get your heart rate up and prepare your muscles for the workout. 
 2. Focus on compound exercises : In a short workout, you want to focus on exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once. Examples include burpees, mountain climbers, jump squats, and plank jacks. 
 3. Incorporate interval training : Interval training involves alternating between periods of high - intensity exercise and periods of rest or low - intensity exercise. This type of training is great for a short workout because it can be done quickly and effectively. For example, you could do 30 seconds of burpees followed by 30 seconds of rest, then repeat for 10 - 15 minutes. 
 4. Incorporate bodyweight exercises : Bodyweight exercises are great for a short workout because they do not require any equipment and can be done anywhere. Examples include push - ups, squats, lunges, and planks. 
 5. Skip the cool down : In a 15 - minute workout, there is no time for a cooldown. Instead, finish your workout with a few minutes of stretching to help your body recover. 

 60 - Minute Workout : 

 1. Warm - up : Start with a 5 - 10 minute dynamic warm - up, such as jogging, cycling, or jumping jacks. This will get your heart rate up and prepare your muscles for the workout. 
 2. Incorporate strength training : In a longer workout, you have time to incorporate strength training exercises that target specific muscle groups. Examples include squats, deadlifts, bench press, and rows. 
 3. Incorporate cardio : In addition to strength training, include some cardio exercises to get your heart rate up and burn calories. Examples include jogging, cycling, or using a cardio machine at the gym. 
 4. Incorporate flexibility and mobility exercises : In a longer workout, you have time to include exercises that improve flexibility and mobility, such as yoga or Pilates. 
 5. Incorporate a cooldown : After your workout, take 5 - 10 minutes to cool down with stretching exercises. This will help your body recover and prevent soreness. 

 Overall, the key to designing a successful workout is to prioritize the most effective exercises and optimize the workout to maximize the time available. Whether you have 15 minutes or 60 minutes, make the most of your time and focus on exercises that will give you the best results.   Designing a workout with only 15 minutes available can be challenging, but it is still possible to get a beneficial and efficient session in. Here are some general tips and advice for creating a 15 - minute workout : 

     Warm - up : Even with a limited time, it is essential to warm up your muscles and joints to prevent injuries. Devote the first 2 - 3 minutes to light cardio, such as jogging in place or jumping jacks, to increase your heart rate and warm up your body. 
     Focus on compound exercises : Compound exercises are movements that work multiple muscle groups simultaneously, allowing you to get a more comprehensive workout in a shorter amount of time. Examples include squats, lunges, push - ups, and planks. 
     Circuit training : Circuit training involves performing a series of exercises back - to - back with minimal rest in between. This allows you to work on both cardiovascular and muscular endurance, making the most of your 15 minutes. Aim for 3 - 4 exercises per circuit, and complete 2 - 3 circuits total. 
     High - intensity interval training ( HIIT ): HIIT involves alternating between short bursts of intense activity and brief periods of rest. This can help you burn more calories and improve your cardiovascular fitness in a shorter amount of time. Incorporate HIIT into your circuit training or as a standalone activity. 
     Prioritize your goals : Determine your fitness goals and design your workout accordingly. If you 're focused on building strength, prioritize compound exercises and lift heavier weights for fewer reps. If you 're focused on improving cardiovascular fitness, incorporate more high - intensity activities and prioritize lighter weights with more reps. 
     Rest and recovery : While it is essential to make the most of your 15 minutes, it is also crucial to listen to your body and take breaks when needed. If you feel exhausted or your form starts to suffer, take a short break to catch your breath and refocus. 
     Cool down : Even though your workout is short, it is still essential to cool down and stretch your muscles to prevent soreness and improve recovery. Devote the last 2 - 3 minutes to stretching, focusing on your major muscle groups. 

 If you have over an hour for your workout, you can follow a more traditional format with a longer warm - up, more extensive circuit training or HIIT, and a more comprehensive cool down. You can also incorporate additional elements, such as mobility work, core exercises, or active recovery, to create a more well - rounded session. 

 Designing a 15 - minute workout involves selecting exercises that are effective, efficient, and challenging within a short time frame. Here are some general tips and considerations for designing a 15 - minute workout : 

     Choose compound exercises : Compound exercises like squats, lunges, push - ups, and rows work multiple muscle groups at once, making them ideal for a 15 - minute workout. 
     Incorporate high - intensity interval training ( HIIT ): HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by rest periods. This type of training can be highly effective in a short amount of time. 
     Select exercises that target multiple muscle groups : A well - rounded workout should include exercises that target various muscle groups throughout the body. For example, you can combine lower body exercises like squats and lunges with upper body exercises like push - ups and rows. 
     Keep the rest periods short : Rest periods should be kept short to maintain a high level of intensity and prevent muscle fatigue. 
     Avoid a cooldown : Since you only have 15 minutes, you may not have time for a full cooldown. Instead, focus on finishing strong and ending your workout with a few exercises that target your core and major muscle groups. 
     Adjust the intensity : If you have more than 15 minutes, you can adjust the intensity of your workout by adding more rounds, increasing the number of reps or sets, or decreasing the rest periods. 
     Stay safe : Always warm up before starting your workout and listen to your body. If you feel fatigued or experience any discomfort, stop the exercise and rest. 

 Remember, the key to an effective 15 - minute workout is to choose exercises that are efficient, challenging, and target multiple muscle groups. By incorporating compound exercises, HIIT, and exercises that target multiple muscle groups, you can create a well - rounded workout that provides a great cardiovascular and strength training workout in a short amount of time.
