< START > hypertrophy v strength training : what be the difference ?
there be some key difference between train for hypertrophy v strength .
hypertrophy refers to increase the size of the muscle , which be do by increase the overall volume of your workout ( set x rep ) .
strength train refers to increase the ability of a muscle to produce force , which be do through lift heavy weight ( above 85 percent of 1 rep max ) .
in short , hypertrophy be how big a muscle be , while strength be how strong a muscle be .
understand the difference between hypertrophy v strength training be important to understand since it be go to impact the type of workout and protocol you do in the gym .
in this article , i will explain : pro vs con of hypertrophy v strength train the difference between hypertrophy and strength training ?
who should do hypertrophy vs strength training ?
what be hypertrophy ?
hypertrophy be the physiological process of increase the size of muscle fiber through resistance training hypertrophy be the physiological process of increase the size of muscle fiber , typically in diameter , through resistance training .
there be two main type of muscle hypertrophy : sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and myofibril hypertrophy .
sarcoplasmic hypertrophy be what most people mean when they refer to hypertrophy training .
it be the physical increase of the muscle .
myofibril hypertrophy be when a muscle become more dense and compact .
these type of hypertrophy usually happen together , and so for practical purpose the distinction do not really matter .
but if you continue to read more about this topic , you will probably run into these term , which be why it be worth mention .
benefit of hypertrophy training below be four benefit of hypertrophy training .
note that many of these benefit can also be see with strength training as well , especially in beginner lifter .
build more muscle while both hypertrophy and strength training build muscle , the general consensus be that hypertrophy base training allows for great increase in muscle size and growth than heavy , strength base training .
hypertrophy training allow lifter to train in high volume , for long period of time , which have be show to be one of the most significant and effective variable for muscle growth less risk of injury weight training entail lift weight , and some injury risk be part of the process .
that say , hypertrophy training often have less risk of injury due to lighter load and less injury risk when training closure to failure .
increase energy expenditure energy expenditure can be increase by increase your output .
in other word , the more work you do ( training volume ) , the more calorie you burn .
hypertrophy training be know to have high level of set , rep , and overall volume , and therefore may be a great option for lifter who be look to increase muscle while also burn a ton of calorie .
this be not to say the heavy strength base program do not burn calorie , because they certainly do .
what it mean however be that lift with light to moderate load , with more rep , will equate to more work be do ( train volume ) , and that can increase calorie expenditure .
improves muscular symmetry hypertrophy training allow you to back off on focus on move a load from point a to point b , and really learn how to engage muscle , attack lag muscle group , and correct movement asymmetry .
when train with heavy load , it may be difficult to think about how the muscle feel or how to slow the moment down , as the load itself be one rep away from cruise you .
hypertrophy training give you the opportunity to build some more muscle awareness and improve muscle growth and symmetry , so that when it come time to lift heavy load you be in a more prepared and more injury - proofed state .
drawback of hypertrophy training below be two potential drawback of hypertrophy training .
note that these limitation be less significant with beginner , as they often can increase their strength at the same time they build muscle , and be often able to handle more volume simply because their absolute loading be often less than a more advanced lifter .
may not increase strength as effectively as strength specific training research show that the increase in muscle size ( often due to sarcoplasmic hypertrophy ) do not always lead to increase in functional strength of force output .
this be especially the case with more advanced lifter , and be why most lifter will train hypertrophy the farthest away from a strength competition to allow them to train hypertrophy properly , then shift back into a more strength focused program .
by do a program that progress from hypertrophy to strength , the lifter be able to reap the benefit of both training program .
could result in overuse injury without adequate recovery training hypertrophy mean you be often train in high volume , which may result in you train more than your recovery allow .
while this be often remedied by more sleep , more food , and a good training program that can track your progress and adjust as need base on your progress , it be still something to be aware of .
what be strength ?
strength can be define as the ability to generate maximal force through a muscle contraction .
strength be often demonstrate through heavy lifting and maxing out .
the ability to generate maximum level of force be dependent on a few key factor , such as : the central nervous system , rate of force production , and neural fatigue .
central nervous system the central nervous system be the control center for all movement and hard training .
it be make up of your brain and spinal cord .
when you train heavy , you train the nervous system to withstand heavy load without inhibit your ability to train hard .
the more your nervous system be prepare for heavy load , the less likely you be to pick something up and feel instantly tire or drain .
this be one of the main benefit of strength training and one of the more specific outcome of heavy training .
rate of force production faster rate of force production equate to more force be produce at once , which can help you move heavy load more efficiently , be more explosive , and break through stick point .
you can develop this by lift heavy load , as well as lift load with more velocity ( speed ) .
neural fatigue this occur when the central nervous system do not have enough recovery time due to lift too heavy , do too many set and rep , or train too much in general .
when neural fatigue occurs , you will often feel overly sluggish , have decrease performance and motivation , and will need to take often some time off , often week , from heavy training .
benefit of strength training below be two benefit of strength training .
while hypertrophy program can offer some beginner these benefit , more advanced lifter or lifter who have not do a proper strength train program will find that a more strength specific training program offer them these benefit .
increase neural drive and peak strength strength specific training increase the central nervous system be ability to send impulse to the muscle fiber to contract .
these impulse can improve the rate at which the muscle fiber contract ( rate of force production ) as well as how many of them contract at once ( fire synchronization ) .
both of these factor will allow you to move heavy load more efficiently .
can maintain or build strength while train less heavy strength training can help you maintain strength when cutting , mainly due to the central nervous system be stimulate under heavy load .
when people eat less , they often think they need to stop lift heavy , but rather , they should keep some heavy lifting in as they can not lose as much strength during a weight loss phase .
this be very important for strength base athlete who be lose weight for competition .
drawback of strength training below be two potential ( and likely ) drawback of strength training , especially when do in excessive volume , poor recovery , improper form , or lack of a deloading .
can lead to neural fatigue more easily than hypertrophy fatigue can happen during any period where you be train hard than you can recover from , however , neural fatigue often occur during high volume , high intensity ( load ) strength program .
while there be no clear guideline on what constitute something be too high in volume or intensity , as individual recovery rate can vary , it be often see when lifter train too heavy for too long or for too many reps. for example , do 6 - 8 set of 5 rep with 85 percent or more load on thing like back squat and deadlifts , and go to all out failure every set , multiple time a week , for week on end .
since the nervous system become much more involved when heavy load be lift , it can also be fatigue more easily at high intensity and high volume .
if you do overly tax your nervous system , the recovery process be much long than take a few day off of training , often several week until you feel fully recover .
neural fatigue be often a more serious issue with more advanced lifter or lifter who also have high stressor outside the gym .
may increase risk of injury and/or overuse injury lifting in high volume and train hard , no matter the training program ( hypertrophy v strength ) can result in some injury if proper form and recovery be not prioritize .
strength training , however , can increase injury risk and overuse injury , especially with poor recovery , high stress , and high volume strength program , as the loading be high than that use in hypertrophy program .
7 difference between hypertrophy & strength 7 difference between hypertrophy and strength the 7 difference between hypertrophy and strength be : training volume be high in hypertrophy than strength training total set perform be not significantly different in hypertrophy v strength program reps range be high in hypertrophy program than strength program load should be light when training for hypertrophy you can train close to fatigue more when training for hypertrophy compound exercise be best for strength development rest period can be as long as need for both hypertrophy and strength training volume be high in hypertrophy than strength train one of the main difference between hypertrophy training and strength training be the total amount of work volume accumulate within a session and program .
training volume can be calculate by multiply set x rep x load , and generally speak hypertrophy training be high in training volume due to the ability to perform more set and rep with less load than heavy , strength training .
this be not to say that you can not train in high frequency with heavy load , however , fatigue ( neural ) and overuse injury ( strain , tendinitis , connective tissue ) becomes much more of a factor when try to do heavy load in high volume .
total set perform be not significantly different in hypertrophy v strength program both hypertrophy and strength program will have a lifter perform 2 - 5 set of a give movement , however in some case 5 - 10 set may be program during strength training program because of the reduced number of reps. the total number of set perform can vary greatly base on the program , and be often not a key differentiator between hypertrophy v strength training , as rep and load be often manipulate to a great extent .
rep range be high in hypertrophy program than strength program hypertrophy rep range can vary greatly when compare to strength train rep range .
hypertrophy can occur in a wide variety of rep range , as the key driver for muscle growth be often train the muscle to fatigue and get the muscle burn , which can be do training in the 5 - 10 , 10 - 20 , and even 20 - 30 rep range ; as long as the muscle be take to failure .
if the muscle be not take to failure after 25 - 30 rep , the loading be too light to bring about significant improvement in muscle hypertrophy .
similarly , if the lifter fatigue prior to 5 rep , muscle damage be do , but not enough overall training volume can be accomplish often due to the lifter get generally tire before the muscle itself have be fatigue .
this be why most program recommend you to train in the 8 - 15 rep range to failure or very close to failure for best result if your goal be hypertrophy .
if you be look to increase strength , your rep range will often be between 1 - 5 rep per set , as the loading be above 80 percent of your maximum ( for example 5 x 5 workout at 80 percent load ) .
if you be train more rep than that , you be certainly increase muscle , however you may not actually be use heavy enough load to increase your strength maximally .
load should be light when training for hypertrophy training intensity refers to the load , more specialty how heavy it be relative to the lifter be maximum .
muscle hypertrophy occur use load between 30 - 80 percent of one be one - rep max , whereas strength training typically occur above the 80 percent of their one - rep max .
this be a key difference between the two , as you can have significant increase in muscle growth and size with light load ( 30 - 80 percent of max ) , however you need to lift above 80 percent to bring about the neural adaptation that take place to increase strength output .
you can train close to fatigue more when training for hypertrophy when hypertrophy be the goal , you can often train close to failure as the load be light and the failure be muscle failure rather than the body as a whole give out .
when look to increase muscle size and growth , local muscle failure ( such as what you feel in your quad when you do a ton of seat leg extension ) be the name of the game .
strength training be often more effective when you do not train to complete failure , as you run the risk of overtraining and injury as loading be much higher relative to your maximum .
compound exercise be best for strength development during hypertrophy training program , the goal be to train the muscle to fatigue , which can be do use a variety of load , rep range , and movement .
when train to failure it be often helpful to use machine and isolated movement as you can truly push the muscle to fatigue and not be limit by other muscle give out or form breakdown .
however , if you be look to increase max strength , you need to train movement that allow you to train with heavy load .
compound exercise be great for this , and the limiting factor for these will often be how heavy the load be rather than how much balance or coordination you need , or exercise that may not allow you to load up as much weight .
for example , do back squat with a barbell be much easy to load up 315lbs than it be to do kettlebell goblet squat with 315lbs .
research suggest that if you be train for maximal strength , you should prioritize movement that have you as stable as possible that be do with movement that allow you to load up with heavy load , whereas thing like bodyweight training , kettlebells , and isolation exercise may be best for hypertrophy or endurance program .
rest period can be as long as need for both hypertrophy and strength hypertrophy program may have short rest period than strength program because the loading be less .
however research suggest that long rest period for hypertrophy program may actually be more effective at allow individual to push to fatigue and increase muscle size , as short rest period may not allow them to push as hard .
they will feel tired , but the muscle may not be train as hard directly .
generally speak , rest period should take as long as it be need for the lifter to push as hard as they need to on the work set ( with the one exception list above ) .
if they can not perform as well as prior set , this be often due to not rest enough between set ( you will have some fatigue that set in , however this drop off should not be drastic ) .
who should do hypertrophy ?
strength athlete can benefit from perform a hypertrophy training program hypertrophy training go hand in hand with strength training , and be a necessary prerequisite for optimal strength development and injury prevention .
generally speak , lifter who be concern with gain size and muscle mass , and who be less concerned with maximal strength develop during their current training block can focus more on hypertrophy training .
they will still build foundational strength , and will be in a good position to transition to a more strength focused training program follow a few month of hypertrophy training .
strength athlete can benefit from perform a hypertrophy train program as a period where they can build more muscle , decrease stress and loading on the body , and help their body recover from prior high intensity training program .
this temporary shift in training focus could also lend itself to long term progress in strength development as well .
who should do strength ?
as state above , strength and hypertrophy go hand in hand and be critical phase of training for all lifter .
for lifter who be concern with peak strength , whether for athletic reason or competition , then they need to train with heavy load to have the nervous system adapt to heavy load .
strength - base lifter should however take a temporary break from lift heavy load every few month and enter a more hypertrophy focused training program to allow for more muscle tissue to be build and recovery of the nervous system and connective tissue to recover .
for lifter who generally do not lift heavy , enter a strength train program be a great way to add muscle and elevate your strength so that when you return to a more hypertrophy base training you will be able to continually progress , as at some point you will need to lift heavy to gain more muscle .
faq : hypertrophy v strength do hypertrophy also increase strength ?
for beginner and intermediate lifter , train hypertrophy will often increase strength , however in more advanced lifter a more strength focus training phase do after a hypertrophy phase be recommend if peak strength be the goal .
do hypertrophy make you big ?
generally speak , hypertrophy training increase muscle size .
while it can also increase strength , muscle hypertrophy increase the size of muscle fiber , as well as increase the amount of fluid push into the muscle to provide energy , refer to as sarcoplasmic hypertrophy ( generally do use high rep range and less load ) .
do you need to lift heavy for hypertrophy ?
no , you do not need to lift as heavy to gain muscle .
hypertrophy can be train with load between 5 - 30 rep , however muscle failure be a key factor .
for best result , experiment with the 5 - 10 rep range , 10 - 20 rep range , and 20 - 30 rep range to see which offer you the best stimulus to the muscle .
< END > < START > hypertrophy vs. strength training : a complete comparison weight training be one of the most important type of exercise you can do for your body .
whether you use free weight , band , medicine ball , or simply perform bodyweight exercise , train your muscle to become strong be beneficial for everyone – not just bodybuilder who be try to build a competition - ready physique .
research show that resistance training be associate with good cardiovascular fitness , resistance to injury and back pain , and reduce risk of diabetes and heart disease .
even a 20 minute session with dumbbell or circuit machine be enough to provide you with many of the health benefit of weight training .
when it come to train your muscle , there be two broad variety : strength training and hypertrophy training .
strength train refers to the type of lift focus on improve strength .
hypertrophy training refers to growth of muscle cell because of exercise .
it be important to note that these kind of workout be not mutually exclusive – many lifter will mix in hypertrophy workout along with their normal strength training routine , both as a new challenge and as a way to ensure their muscle do not get use to their normal routine .
however , at some point it be typically beneficial to decide if you want to focus on muscular strength or muscle size .
this article will go over these two idea , what they typically entail , and provide some recommendation on which type of weight training may be best for your personal goal .
what be strength training ?
as the name implies , a strength training program be one that be design to increase your strength , or the amount of force your muscle can exert .
unlike workout routine that be design primarily to add muscle mass , strength training focus on improve your ability to push , pull , squeeze , lift , squat and jump among other movement of the body .
some who participate in strength training focus on one or two specific type of lift , such as olympic powerlifters who compete in event to see how much they can deadlift or bench press .
to build muscle strength , you must perform exercise that break down your body temporarily so that more muscle fiber can be add in the `` damage `` area during rest period .
because they allow you to hit more muscle group at once , people focus on gain strength typically create a program of compound lift .
compound exercise often incorporate barbell or dumbbell and include exercise like : bench press deadlift squat military press besides the use of compound exercise , strength training be also distinct from hypertrophy training because of the way lift be program .
strength train usually involve heavy weight with a low training volume .
this typically mean you will perform a small number of set , but your lift will be high intensity since you will be use heavy weight .
also , as mention above , strength training focus more on compound lift that recruit big muscle as well as small tendon and ligament .
for example , bench press be a staple of many strength training program , since it utilize almost every upper body muscle include your chest , triceps , forearm , and others .
what be muscle hypertrophy training ?
while both hypertrophy and strength training will involve perform many of the same exercise with the same kind of equipment , the goal of hypertrophy training be a little different .
when your focus be on build the muscle tissue to be as large as possible , you will want to use a high rep range with light weight .
also , hypertrophy training emphasize isolation exercise that use only one or two muscle at a time .
some common exercise you would see on a plan focus on hypertrophy include : bicep curl quadriceps extension dumbbell fly hypertrophy - style training be popular in the bodybuilding community , where there be often a need to focus on muscle growth in very specific area to ensure the physique as a whole be ready for competition .
set perform in these kind of training session will also have high rep when compare to the kind of low rep , compound lift training that help cause strength gain .
because this type of training require light weight but more rep and set , it may take long than a traditional strength training workout .
you may also have to perform a variety of different type of move than you would on a plan focus on maximize strength gain .
a strength train workout with a barbell might call for only three or four different lift , while a hypertrophy plan may require six or more .
scientific research indicate that certain kind of exercise can induce hypertrophy in the muscle without a corresponding increase in strength .
which method be right for me ?
although these training method be different , neither be inherently good than the other .
many athlete incorporate both technique at different time , as their goal may change throughout the year .
here be a few tip for decide on whether your routine should be primarily base on gain strength or building muscle : if you be participate in athletic competition , you may want to focus on a specific type of strength training .
for example , soccer player might want to create a weightlifting program that help them get strong in their low body .
if you want to focus on get big in a specific area , such as your shoulder or chest , you might want to create a lifting plan that help you add skeletal muscle mass in these area through hypertrophy .
if you be new to lifting , you may want to start out with a focus on compound strength training exercise .
beginner have a tendency to add muscle quickly regardless of what kind of lift they do , and you may start out reap more benefit from compound exercise that use multiple muscle .
you can always switch to a training goal that be more focused on add mass once you gain more experience .
again , there be no reason you have to choose one or the other permanently .
many people mix it up .
on certain day they perform exercise with a limited range of motion that focus on activation of specific muscle group .
day , they will perform compound movement like lunge , deadlifts and pull - ups as a way to hit many different muscle group at the same time .
however you will still want to choose one main goal so that you know where to focus the majority of your effort .
final thought on choose between hypertrophy vs. strength training at the end of the day , both type of training be design to use the principle of progressive overload on the nervous system to break down muscle fiber so they can be rebuild strong , in a large quantity .
whether you want to focus on muscle building so that you can gain size , or you would rather improve functional , short - burst strength by focus on train fast - twitch muscle , perform some kind of resistance training be important for your health .
the cdc recommend perform muscle - strengthening activity that work all major muscle group at least two day per week .
whichever route you decide , by create a routine that work for your specific need , stay consistent over the long - term , and provide your body with adequate rest and nutrition , you can change your body and achieve your strength goal .
< END > < START > fast facts strength training and hypertrophy training be two different regimen that yield different physical result .
strength training increase muscle strength , while hypertrophy training increase muscle size .
the best choice between hypertrophy versus strength training come down to your personal goal and level of experience .
muscle strength and muscle size be definitely relate .
when you be new to lift weight , nearly any rep and set regimen will help you get strong and big .
but as you become a seasoned lifter , your result will begin to slow .
what once work ( everything ) be not help you pack on mass or strength like it be before .
what then ?
that be where tailor your training program specifically for strength or hypertrophy ( muscle growth ) can help .
what be the difference between strength versus hypertrophy training , which should you choose , and how to do it ?
if you want to build muscle mass , strength , or both , listen up .
hypertrophy versus strength training strength training and hypertrophy training be two distinct style of resistance training that each rely on different rep and set , weight , and exercise to achieve target result .
strength training make muscle strong , while hypertrophy training make muscle big .
here be how .
what be strength training ?
strength training be the best way to optimize functional muscle performance .
by train for strength , you will train your muscle be ability to produce maximal force .
to build strength , it be key to lift at heavy load .
to do it , drop your rep ( 2 - 6 ) , and lift heavy weight ( above 85 - percent of one rep max ) .
by cut the rep you will be able to focus on high - quality rep at more weight .
benefit of strength training strength - specific training will not just maximize your overall and peak strength .
here be a few of the other benefit you can expect : increase caloric expenditure and metabolism enhance athletic performance increase functional fitness increase bone density and muscle mass build or maintain strength while train less what be hypertrophy training ?
if you be look to visibly build muscle mass , hypertrophy training will yield the large size gain .
to enhance muscle size , it be vital to increase the overall volume ( reps and set ) during your session .
to do it , increase your rep ( 8 - 12 ) , and lift moderate to heavy load ( 65 to 85 - percent of one rep max ) .
by drop the weight , you will be able to squeeze in more rep per set in comparison to strength training .
benefit of hypertrophy training with hypertrophy , the aim be to achieve an aesthetic look by building big , bulky muscle .
however , that be not the only benefit .
a well - design hypertrophy program will also : increase caloric expenditure and metabolism increase muscular symmetry and reduce strength imbalance reduce risk of injury increase strength and power take note : strength training increase muscle mass , and hypertrophy training can also increase strength .
you ca not have one without the other .
but hypertrophy outperforms strength training for optimize muscle growth , and vice - versa .
which be well : strength versus hypertrophy training ?
there be no bad choice .
it come down to your goal .
if you want to increase the size of your muscle , hypertrophy training be for you if you want to increase the strength of your muscle , consider strength training should you try strength or hypertrophy training first ?
if you be a beginner , you should always do hypertrophy training first .
by start with hypertrophy early in your strength training career , you will be build both muscle and strength .
take your time to develop muscle mass , learn the proper technique , and gain some confidence .
when you do move on to strength training , you will have the muscle mass and technique to keep you safe when training at high load .
key difference between strength and hypertrophy training when it come to strength and hypertrophy training , each follow specific protocol for rep and set range , overall training volume , exercise selection , and nutrition .
here be the major difference .
exercise selection because the goal of strength training be max force production , your workout should center around multi - joint compound lift — like squat , deadlifts , bench press , and pull - ups .
but with hypertrophy training , you will want to use a combination of compound and isolation exercise to maximize muscle growth .
train specific muscle in isolation — like hammer curl , or leg extension — be not great for build functional strength , but it can be helpful in stimulate specific muscle group to grow .
your exercise progression during these phase of training should vary too .
since you work with light weight during hypertrophy training , increase set and rep , load , or add complexity to an exercise be all great way to continue build muscle .
because strength training relies on adequate overload , complexity be not your friend .
example of complexity include alternate arm and leg , or add a balance element to make an exercise more challenging .
often complexity take away from your ability to produce force .
instead , focus on increase your load or set to progress during strength training .
< END > < START > many , include bodybuilder , pursue muscular strength , endurance , and physique .
but achieve the desire outcome have become a challenge since countless training approach exist .
as a result , many fitness enthusiast have be leave ponder which path to pursue .
resistance training be one of the best way to train your muscle to become strong and big .
but as you begin resistance training , you realize there be two different approach to achieve these goal .
on the one hand , you have strength training focus on raw power and maximal force production .
on the other hand , you have hypertrophy training , which aim to stimulate muscle growth and sculpt a visually impressive physique .
the two popular workout be intertwine method but be different .
each approach bring its unique benefit and target different aspect of physical performance .
this article dive deep into strength versus hypertrophy to understand the fundamental difference between these train method .
what be hypertrophy ?
hypertrophy be increase or enlarge muscle fiber be size and volume result from target resistance training .
it be popular among bodybuilder who focus more on increase muscle size to achieve a visually impressive physique than strength and endurance .
like any other fitness goal , acute variable training , such as select exercise and technique , be crucial in achieve hypertrophy .
additionally , the number of repetition , intensity , set , and training frequency all create the ideal environment for hypertrophy .
they determine the stress level you must put on muscle to achieve your fitness goal .
hypertrophy training typically involve a high training volume of high repetition per set , range from 6 to 12 repetition at a low intensity of 75–85 percent of your 1rm , and multiple set , three to five .
this rep range be commonly associate with hypertrophy because it maximize time under tension , promote muscle damage and metabolic stress .
the training be perform use lighter weight with low intensity .
therefore , it may take long to see the result than a person do a strength training workout .
you may also need to do a wide range of movement that target specific muscle group from various angle than strength training .
the hypertrophy training routine should include compound exercise such as back squat , deadlifts , bench press , and t - bar row to recruit multiple muscle group simultaneously .
you may also need to incorporate isolation exercise , such as bicep curl or leg extension , to target individual muscle .
benefit of hypertrophy below be four pro of hypertrophy : increased muscle mass while hypertrophy and strength training increase muscle size , hypertrophy allow a tremendous increase in muscle size and growth .
this be because hypertrophy enables you to train in high volume ( do more rep and set ) for an extended period .
the high the training volume , the more mass increase .
enhance functional fitness and injury prevention although hypertrophy training be often associate with bodybuilding and aesthetic , it also have functional fitness and injury prevention benefit .
as the muscle increase , they provide good support and stability to the joint .
improved structural integrity help to prevent injury during physical activity and sport .
additionally , hypertrophy involve lift light weight which often have less risk of injury when training .
promotes muscular symmetry perform workout incorrectly can cause imbalance in muscle development .
by target specific muscle , you can address muscle imbalance use hypertrophy workout , which can help create a more proportionate and symmetrical physique , enhance aesthetic and functional ability .
increase energy expenditure one way to increase energy expenditure be by increase your training volume ( output ) .
and since hypertrophy involve perform more rep , set , and overall high training volume , it can be the best way to burn more calorie while increase muscle size .
hypertrophy con below be four drawback of hypertrophy : reduced strength and power while hypertrophy increase muscle size , it do not increase strength and power like strength training .
research show that muscle mass increase due to sarcoplasmic hypertrophy do not always increase strength or force .
overused injury hypertrophy training can place substantial stress on your muscle , tendon , and joint as it involve high volume , intense workout , and repetitive movement .
also , the training have short resting time .
without sufficient muscle recovery time between session , the body may be unable to repair and adapt , increase the risk of overuse injury .
focus on aesthetic over function compare to strength training , which emphasize strength and endurance , hypertrophy training often strongly emphasize aesthetic and muscle size , which may not align with everyone be fitness goal or functional need .
risk of overtraining due to high training volume and lack of adequate time to recover between workout , intense hypertrophy training can push the body to its limit , increase the risk of overtraining .
what be strength training ?
while hypertrophy be focus on increase muscle size , strength training be a type of resistance training exercise focus on increase the ability of your muscle to produce strength and endurance .
the workout mainly focus on improve muscle strength , power , and perseverance to enhance your ability to push , pull and lift weight , among other exercise .
to stimulate strength gain , the muscle must be subject to a level of resistance that exceed what they be accustom to .
the progressively heavy weight or increase resistance apply stress to your muscle , cause microscopic damage to the muscle fiber .
this damage stimulate physiological response that force the body to adapt to the increase demand , improve strength .
unlike hypertrophy , strength training usually involve lift heavy weight with low training volume .
this mean you perform few set of about 4 - 6 set per workout but with high intensity of 85–100 percent of your single - rep weight capacity .
the high intensity often improve with strength .
strength training workout usually target large and multiple muscle group and joint in one action to enhance overall strength .
these include muscle like the chest , back , shoulder , arm , and leg .
typical exercise include squat , deadlifts , bench press , shoulder press , row , lunge , and various upper - body and low - body exercise .
benefit of strength training while strength and hypertrophy training share common benefit , strength training have some distinct advantage compare to hypertrophy - focused training .
they include : increased strength strength training program often involve lift heavy weight at low repetition , aim to develop the neuromuscular system , improve the force production rate , and fire synchronization necessary for lift great load .
this focus on maximal strength can be particularly beneficial for you or athlete such as olympic power lifter involve in sport that require explosive power .
enhance neuromuscular coordination strength train improves neuromuscular coordination — efficient communication and synchronization between the nervous system and muscle .
by perform complex movement and progressively increase the load , strength training enhance the nervous system be ability to recruit and activate the appropriate muscle fiber , improve coordination and motor skill .
joint stability and injury prevention strength train target the muscle surround and support the joint .
this increase stability and reduce the risk of injury like sprain , strain , and instability .
con of strength training despite strength training have pro , it also have its con .
they include : increased risk of injury strength train involves lift heavy weight and perform complex movement under high intensity .
this can increase the risk of injury if proper form , technique , and safety precaution be not follow .
neural fatigue neural fatigue refers to a decrease in the ability of the nervous system to recruit and activate muscle fiber efficiently , result in a reduction in strength and performance .
lift heavy weight at high intensity , as in strength training , place significant stress on the nervous system , lead to neural fatigue , especially when training session be frequent without adequate recovery period .
hypertrophy vs. strength training which be the best ?
hypertrophy and strength training interconnect with each other .
when you perform hypertrophy , the increase muscle can result in an improvement in strength .
when you do strength training , the ability to perform workout for long period increase , possibly result in hypertrophy .
although these workout be interconnect , you can choose the one you want to focus on depend on your fitness goal .
focus on hypertrophy if your fitness goal be big muscle and a well - define muscular physique .
the training will help you add skeletal muscle mass in targeted area like your shoulder or chest .
if you be an athlete participating in athletic performance , strength training may suit you .
create a strength training program target the area you need to increase strength .
if you be new to lifting , the national academy of sport medicine recommend build a solid foundation through compound strength training before try hypertrophy .
besides , novice tend to develop muscle rapidly regardless of the type of lift they do .
thus , you may begin reap hypertrophy benefit from strength training compound exercise that use multiple muscle .
upon gain more experience and a strong foundation , you can switch to hypertrophy training if muscle gain be your goal .
also , you can mix hypertrophy and strength training exercise if you be advance in weightlift and want to improve strength and endurance alongside increase muscle mass .
for instance , you can perform hypertrophy workout with a constrained range of motion on certain day to activate and increase the size of specific muscle group .
on alternate day , you use strength training compound exercise like deadlifts , lunge , and press - ups to work for numerous muscle group simultaneously .
however , choose one main goal be still important to know where to focus most of your time and energy .
conclusion understand the difference between hypertrophy and strength training approach be essential to unlock your full potential and achieve your fitness goal .
strength training build a foundation of power , resilience , and functional prowess .
it empower you to conquer physical challenge , excel in athletic pursuit , and develop a body capable of efficiently perform everyday activity .
on the other hand , hypertrophy training delve into the art of muscle growth and aesthetic .
it sculpt and shape your physique , create visually impressive result that showcase your dedication and hard work .
embrace the difference in these training approach by dive into the world of strength and hypertrophy .
< END > < START > can you train to build strength and build muscle at the same time ?
that be a question you may have wonder .
if you look around , there seem to be a big gap between the physique of those who strive to only build strength , like powerlifters , and those who only strive to build muscle , like bodybuilder .
so , be it possible ?
the simple answer be a resounding yes .
strength & hypertrophy go hand - in - hand not only can you build muscle and strength at the same time , but those two thing go hand - in - hand .
in fact , these go hand - in - hand so much so that if you be to pick one as a goal , you would get some of the other as a byproduct .
what i mean by that be that if you choose strength as your main focus , you would still see muscle growth and if you choose muscle growth as your main goal , you would notice your strength increase .
there be no way to avoid this completely because the same principle use to build muscle be use to build strength and vice - versa .
with big muscle come the possibility of more strength and with more strength come the possibility of big muscle .
do not believe me ?
take a look at 8 time mr olympia winner .
obviously , his main goal be to build muscle and have the great physique on the planet , yet you can find video of him deadlifting over 800 lb and bench almost 500 lb .
the correlation between size & strength why be there such a correlation between size and strength ?
one reason be that because when you increase the size of the muscle fiber , there be more potential for them to handle the heavy weight , as there be simply more fiber to be recruit to handle the load .
this just make sense , as we typically associate big with strong .
in line with that , great strength mean a great ability to handle a heavy load , which should allow you to handle more volume than someone with less strength .
volume ( weight x set x rep ) have be show time and time again to be the driving force for size ( and strength ) .
so , if you can handle more weight , theoretically you have potential to build more muscle than someone weaker .
training for both here be an example : imagine someone with a one rep max ( 1rm ) of 225 lb ( 102 kg ) and another person with a 1rm of 315 lb ( 142.8 kg ) .
“ rm ” mean rep max .
theoretically , the person with the 225 lb max would be able to comfortably do set of 10 rep with around 150 lb ( 68 kg ) while the person with the 315 lb max would be able to comfortably do set of 10 with 205 lb ( 93 kg ) .
who do you think would build more muscle over time ?
obviously , the person lift the heavy load would be able to do more volume and would be more likely to experience great muscle growth as a result .
because of these thing , i would say that it be not only possible to train for hypertrophy and strength but that everyone look for either should train for both , at least to a degree .
since the two be not mutually exclusive , it be of great benefit to draw from muscle building and strength building practice .
so , if you be try to build pure strength , you should be look to learn some thing from bodybuilder .
if you be try to build massive muscle , you should be look to learn some thing from powerlifters .
a simple way to get the most out of your training for strength and hypertrophy be to vary the rep range you use in a week .
utilize low rep range with heavy weight as well as more moderate load with high reps. this will help you get the advantage of both .
of course , you can favor one or the other more depend on your goal , but the variation will definitely leave you good off than just do set of 10 - 12 for hypertrophy or set of 3 - 5 for strength every day , each week .
take - home message so , to recap , train for strength and hypertrophy be not only possible but unavoidable to a degree but definitely recommend .
by train for both in a week , you will allow yourself to get the benefit of both , which will help you whether you be look to primarily build muscle or gain strength .
< END > < START > hypertrophy training be when you train in a manner that promote muscle growth ( hypertrophy ) .
while there be various way to do this , the goal be the same : to increase muscle mass ( which may not be directly in line with increase strength ) .
hypertrophy training vs strength training for most individual ( beginner and intermediate lifter ) do a set of 10 back squat will both build muscle and general strength .
the key difference between the term come when you really define “ strength ” training .
for some , this mean just be able to lift relatively heavy weight .
for others , train strength mean train maximal strength , which be much more nervous system dependent than general hypertrophy training .
for this reason , most training that occur under the 5 rep threshold be often see as “ strength training ” due to the increase relative loading ( close to one be true maximum ) .
below , we will discuss various rep range for train hypertrophy , maximal strength , and general strength and muscle building : all of which be often accomplish in beginner training , but must be specifically attack at more advanced level .
rep range for hypertrophy when you be on a mission to develop big muscle and create more raw material to then transition into heavy strength training , it be important to understand the various repetition range that have be see to promote muscle growth ( which be not the same as maximal strength ) .
it be also important to understand that a lifter can get “ strong ” without actually increase muscle hypertrophy ( size and growth ) , which often occur early in a beginner be workout journey .
this be primarily due to increased muscle coordination and nervous system adaptation .
for this reason , many lifter will often train too heavy while attempt to maximize muscle growth .
for year , gym goer have be program to train 8 - 12 rep for muscle growth and strength .
while these be great recommendation for beginner ( and often where many people who be new to training should do ) , these be general guideline and do not apply as one begin to progress .
muscle hypertrophy when train muscle hypertrophy , various muscle group can respond to rep range differently base on generic , muscle fiber type , and the individual .
for example , individual with more slow twitch quad muscle may have good muscle growth training in the 12 - 20 rep range , whereas lifter who have more fast twitch muscle may just feel beat up training that high of rep ( and do not get delay onset muscle soreness ) .
in those individual , train a low rep range of 8 - 12 might suffice .
for most individual , it be key to experiment within the 8 - 15 rep range , and then work yourself either up to say 15 - 25 rep ( with hard exertion ) , and see what happen .
conversely , train with 5 - 10 rep can also be a good way for some individual to pack on serious muscle mass .
it be recommend however , that train less than 5 rep be reserve for more strength focus training .
hypertrophy this be a range that can be good for lifter who adapt good ( and get a good muscle pump and soreness ) use heavy load and 5 - 10 rep per set .
this be also a good in - between range for lifter who want to progress into a more strength - focused training phase , yet spend some time training in the 8 - 15 , or 15 - 25 rep range .
how to determine which rep range be best for you ?
this can be a challenging question for many lifter , especially when a friend have success do one thing , yet that same exercise and rep range just make your joint hurt .
below be three train outcome that you should look for when training for muscle growth .
if a movement , rep range , and workout provide all three of these , it be generally say that those movement and rep work well for your body and make - up .
1 – do your muscle feel pump up during the workout / set ?
this be instant feedback , and you need to focus on this during a set .
if you can not feel the muscle working , and feel the local muscle fatigue ( like a muscle burn or exhaustion ) , then you either need to lighten the load and focus on the movement , go slow and feel the muscle stretch , and use a fuller range of motion ( or good yet , do all three ) .
2 – do you have muscle soreness a day or two after the workout ?
delay onset muscle soreness be a key indicator of a good muscle hypertrophy session .
that say , muscle soreness be not always indicative of an effective training session , however some slight soreness can be a good sign of muscle stress that will then promote hypertrophy .
it be also important to note that soreness that impede your ability to train in follow workout , or one be that impair your day to day life ( like an overly aggressive workout that create severe leg soreness ) be a good indicator that you be on the right track , you just do too much volume ( too many set ) or train too hard for that session .
3 – be your joint pain free when do the movement ?
if at any point during or after a training session you have joint pain and/or discomfort , which be different from sore muscle , this be an indicator that you be cause too much stress and damage to bone , ligament , and tendon .
this can be cause by many thing , however the most common be ( 1 ) improper training technique , ( 2 ) too heavy of load , ( 3 ) lack of control in a movement .. slow down , and/or ( 4 ) injury .
if you be injure or feel injured , it be best to back off from the movement that cause pain , rest , and determine if you need to see a medical profession .
if pain go away , try perform other exercise for the same muscle group as sometimes a movement might not work well for you , despite it do well for someone else .
look for a workout program ?
the workout will adapt automatically to your level of recovery and rate of progress .
with over 600 movement and exercise videos , you can be sure to perform the movement correctly for optimal result .
take the guesswork out of your workout .
add hypertrophy train into a strength program < END > < START > below be four area where you can add hypertrophy train into a strength program .
it be recommend to train your strength lift first , when you be fresh , and then transition into hypertrophy training with emphasis on the key marker above rather than how heavy you be lift .
unilateral exercise unilateral exercise be a great way to increase muscle activation , hypertrophy , and address any muscle imbalance .
movement like lunge , split squat , single arm press , and single leg hip raise be all good option to choose from .
train these with emphasis on coordination , proper technique and joint mechanic , and feel the muscle should be of the high priority .
single joint movement movement like hamstring curl ( only joint moving be the knee ) , triceps extension ( only joint moving be the elbow ) , and chest fly ( only joint moving be the shoulder ) be all example of single joint exercise .
these be great to address specific weakness or highly area that you may want to grow more muscle mass .
it be not recommend to train these movement with low rep range , so aim to perform 8 - 15 rep on most of these movement , or more .
machine - base lift similar to single joint and unilateral movement , machine be a great way to increase muscle mass without have to place additional stress on supportive muscle group .
while that be generally a benefit for overall fitness , training in an isolated manner after compound strength lift can help target a muscle group without weak supportive muscle hold you back .
let be say for example , you want to grow your quadriceps more , so you attack 4 set of squat for strength .
afterwards , you could train high rep back squat , however you may find your low back fatigue out or you simply feel drain .
instead , perform machine hack squat may be a solid option as it can take pressure off your low back and allow you to isolate the quad more and provide more stimulus for growth .
light compound lifts you can train compound movement , often one you do for strength , for muscle hypertrophy as well .
just be aware that some movement , like high rep deadlifts , will create high amount of systemic ( and nervous system ) fatigue , and may not be the best option for muscle hypertrophy of the hamstring due to the overall stress it promote .
instead , you could train deadlifts for strength , and then move to a less stressful exercise like barbell good morning to specifically target the hamstring .
below be four tip to help you maximize muscle hypertrophy and aid in overall strength development .
1 – monitor training volume your accessory hypertrophy training should be do in a way that support your strength lift .
if you find you be beat yourself up from accessory exercise that cause more fatigue ( you be not recover from workout ) , and/or your strength be not go up , you may be perform too much training volume .
you can refer to this hypertrophy training guideline central hub for more specific recommendation of optimal training volume for muscle growth .
2 – understand your rep range be sure to refer to the rep range guideline from early in this article .
these guideline will help you navigate your accessory training program , and help you good individualize your own muscle growth goal base on how your body react to various rep range .
3 – understand positive marker for muscle growth when training for muscle hypertrophy , it be key to not focus on how much weight you be lift , but rather how your body respond to the stress of a training session .
use the 3 training outcome from above to help guide you along your muscle building journey .
if you find you be fail to accomplish all three objective , then you need to reevaluate your rep range , overall training load ( do too much or not enough ) , technique , range of motion ( fuller be well ) , tempo of movement ( slow and control on lower phase ) , and exercise selection .
4 – know when to back off your hypertrophy training should support your strength goal .
if you find that your hypertrophy training be ( 1 ) create excessive soreness that impede your strength training , ( 2 ) result in joint pain and/or connective tissue issue , or ( 3 ) general lack of recovery ; it be best to back off slightly and do one or two less set per movement and see if that help your body recover over a span of a couple week .
final note when training for muscle hypertrophy , be sure to always monitor overall training volume so that you can maximize muscle growth , allow for recovery , and still train strength .
add too much can certainly be counterproductive , but by follow the tip above you should be able to navigate those water .
lastly , it be also important to note that you can dedicate certain training phase ( 6 - 12 week in length ) to more hypertrophy - focused training , with the strength movement be there to maintain while you push hard on gain muscle mass .
this be often do , and then transition into a more strength - focused period .
< END > < START > maximize both can you get 100 percent of the maximum hypertrophy possible while also get 100 percent of the maximum strength possible , in short no .
there be a reason the top bodybuilder be more jacked than the top powerlifters .
it be not just body fat percentage difference .
there be a reason powerlifters be strong than bodybuilder ( when it come to 1rms ) .
maximize the amount of muscle on your frame be different to have a lot of muscle while try to be as strong as possible .
this be especially important the more advanced you become .
for a completely untrained person there be very little difference between train for maximal strength and maximal hypertrophy .
the more advanced you get the more this diverge .
there be always a trade off for be the best at something .
this do not just apply to lift .
decathletes be not world record holder in any individual event .
you only have limit resource , the specific training require to be the best at one thing take a massive amount of time , energy and recovery resource .
this mean that unless the other thing you be try to be the best at be very similar there will not be enough carryover to be near your potential at both .
100 m and 200 m sprint be a good example .
however this be also only possible due to how much of a genetic freak he be .
if he have only focus on one of them he would have still have be well at that one than when he be train both of them .
you can be world class at one thing and good at many others .
you will not be world class in several thing due to the nature of what it take to be world class .
diminish return it be well to think of strength and hypertrophy as a spectrum , if you maximize strength you ca not maximize hypertrophy and vice versa .
where in this spectrum your training put you will determine how strong you be relative to your size .
as state above you will not be able to get as strong and muscular as possible at the same time , but you can be pretty close to both .
this be a difference that will not matter much unless you be try to compete against others at an elite level .
this be due to diminish return .
you have probably hear of the pareto principle .
if not it mean that roughly 80 percent of the result come from put in 20 percent of the effort .
it do not necessarily apply in all case with those specific percentage but the principle stand well .
there be definitely diminish return .
when you get past a low baseline each unit of effort lead to small and small increase in result .
put number to this if 50 unit of effort get you 100 unit of result .
100 unit of effort may only get you 125 unit of result .
so a 100 percent increase in effort only lead to a 25 percent increase in result .
do not get attach to the specific number , the principle be what be worth note .
how do this apply to combine both ?
let say you have 100 unit of effort to give .
if you purely prioritize one this may give you 100 unit of result in that one and 60 in the other ( as there be carryover between both ) lead to 160 total unit .
if you give 50 unit of effort to both this may give you 90 unit of result in both ( carryover ) lead to 180 total unit of result .
try to balance both would give slightly bad result to either one individually , but good result overall .
this be what a lot of lifter who do not compete would like ( include me ) .
it do not even have to be 50 - 50. if you care about one more it be useful to know how to combine both .
this be all relative to your genetics .
you may try to get as jack as possible and put everything into it .
maximize the effectiveness of your training , diet , sleep , stress management etc over a ten year period .
genetic freak exist and can put in less effort for half the time and get good result .
this be an unfortunate reality but largely irrelevant unless you be compete in something .
all you can focus on be get the best out of yourself , if you have do that there be nothing more you could have do so why worry ?
difference between strength and hypertrophy training this be a good video on the difference between both , i be a fan of r be work .
i remember listen to this 2 - 3 month ago .
there be go to be similarity between what i have write here and what be cover in the video .
there be not much new information come out in the fitness industry , most thing have be say before .
often “ new information ” be just old information put into someone else be word .
however the section at the end of this article explain in detail how to design training for strength and hypertrophy at the same time .
i have not see much on this before so it will be very useful to you if that be something you be interested in .
exercise selection difference exercise selection varies depend on whether you be train primarily for strength or size .
when you be train for strength you have to do specific exercise .
whether they be exercise necessary for the sport you compete in .
such as the straight bar back squat , flat barbell bench press and conventional / sumo deadlift in powerlifting .
or just lift that be a good benchmark of general strength capability even if they be not part of a sport you compete in .
these may include weighted pull ups , weight dip and front squat .
they may easily irritate connective tissue and not stimulate the muscle well for the amount of fatigue they cause .
because these lift be use as benchmark , to get the most out of them you will have to train them .
this allow you to get the skill of the lift down to see where your actual strength lie .
you may have to incorporate certain lift that be not an efficient use of your time / recovery resource .
for hypertrophy there be no mandatory lift .
there be at least several different exercise variation and often many movement pattern that can be use to stimulate every part of each muscle .
you can select exercise that seem to give you the most stimulus for the least fatigue so you can stimulate as much as possible while limit fatigue build up .
hypertrophy focus program will usually include more machine base and isolation single joint lift that use less muscle group .
more of a focus in hypertrophy training than in strength training .
strength focus program will usually include more free weight / bodyweight exercise and multi joint compound movement that allow for more free movement , unlike machine .
hybrid strength and hypertrophy program will be somewhere in between depend on which you be prioritize .
rpe difference as you get more advanced set need to be take to a relatively high rpe to be effective for muscle growth .
set below rpe 6/6.5 or so be not very effective for stimulate hypertrophy .
not that they be ineffective .
they be just not a very efficient .
your time and energy would be good spent at a slightly high rpe if your goal be just hypertrophy .
there be a minimum intensity ( percent 1rm ) to stimulate noticeable strength gain but it be not that high .
75 percent be usually consider the low bound , 80 percent be definitely heavy enough to stimulate strength well .
you could do several single at 80 percent , get a good strength stimulus and still have the hard single still be far below rpe 6. this would be a good way to stimulate strength without stimulate much hypertrophy .
however it be very rare for someone to want to maximize strength while seek absolutely 0 hypertrophy .
this rarely occur unless someone competes in a strength sport and have maxed out their weight class .
most people want a combination of strength and muscle mass .
include some low rpe strength work ( to maximize technical proficiency under heavy load and train the nervous system ) and also some high rpe hypertrophy work be a good way to accomplish both .
the ratio of which can be determine by how important each aspect be to you .
training frequency difference there be 2 different type of training frequency to consider , frequency of train each muscle group and how many day you train per week .
hypertrophy training be more suited to a high number of training day per week .
it be not uncommon for bodybuilder to train 6 day a week .
sometimes this include 2 session per day .
it be very rare for powerlifters to train 6 day per week , 5 be usually the high you will see .
strength training be a lot more neurologically tax due to the heavy load lift .
even when the volume use be not very high it be not possible for most people to get amped up to lift very heavy more than 5 day a week .
i highly doubt he train hard 6 day a week your joint and connective tissue integrity be another variable that have to be consider .
maximal strength training require you to practice specific lift , this practice also need to be heavy .
this mean you need to repeat the same movement pattern relatively frequently with heavy load .
this make it pretty easy to irritate connective tissue if you be not careful with the rest of your programming .
bodybuilding training can use a wider variety of exercise at light load which be more joint friendly .
training frequency per muscle group be quite variable for both .
especially if we consider technically focused session , these be often include in strength program to improve technical efficiency .
when discuss overload session for both you can train more frequently for hypertrophy than for strength .
this be because for hypertrophy train the muscle just need to be at least close to fully recover to overload again .
for strength all of the muscle , connective tissue and nervous system need to be close to fully recover .
the muscular system recover the fast out of these .
overload strength session ca not take place as frequently as overload hypertrophy session .
you have to maximize proficiency with a single lift when it come to strength , this be not true to the same extent for hypertrophy .
this mean you can utilize a large degree of exercise variation for hypertrophy which also allow you to train more frequently .
a good way to combine both each week be to have a strength session for each lift and 1 or more hypertrophy focus session .
these should be spread out so that you be as close to fully recover as possible for the strength session .
you can be slightly fatigue go into the hypertrophy session and still get a good hypertrophy stimulus .
progression difference progression for strength and for hypertrophy be similar but not exactly the same .
you will want to increase performance over time for both ( progressive overload ) but this will manifest in slightly different way for each .
for strength increase load be good than increase reps. it be definitely good than increase set ( volume ) which might actually be counterproductive .
for hypertrophy increase load and rep be both viable tool as long as the rep do not drop too low ( below 5 ) .
increase set ( volume ) throughout a mesocycle be debatable .
i find a good compromise to be keep set for main compound static and increase myo rep cluster on isolation lift .
this allow slight increase in volume without add noticeable fatigue from week to week which would impair strength .
the best way to combine both be to have a strength base day and hypertrophy base day for each movement pattern in each training week ( microcycle ) .
on the strength base day we prioritize load increase as long as rep do not drop too low .
on the hypertrophy base day we can try to increase load ( as long as rep do not drop too low ) .
we can also try to increase rep with the same load .
myo rep cluster on isolation movement can be slightly increase every week as long as the strength base day be not affect .
if not they can remain constant , or just be increase in place where there be enough recovery time after to not affect the strength work .
loading and rep range difference hypertrophy be pretty similar when take to failure in all rep range across the 5 - 30 rep range .
this do not mean that set under 5 rep do not stimulate hypertrophy , they absolutely do .
just that as the rep get low below 5 the set become less stimulative on a per set basis .
squat single be not the best for hypertrophy try to get compound exercise volume from purely set of 5 and below would be great for strength but poor for hypertrophy .
on a pure set for set basis they would be less stimulative .
you would also be able to do less set as you ca not handle as much heavy volume as moderate volume .
when lift very heavy there be also the risk of alter your technique slightly to be able to move more load .
the target muscle would be stimulate even less .
strength be not technically tie to a rep range .
it be purely base on how heavy you be lift relative to your one rep max ( 1rm ) .
however this be manifest in the rep range that you use .
the low the rep the heavy you can lift .
your strength base will be build most effectively with set of around 6 rep and below , however set of 7 - 10 be still effective for strength .
we can combine both of these by have both a strength and hypertrophy session for each muscle group / movement pattern throughout the week .
the strength session can be in the 4 - 7 rep range ( mainly the low end ) , which be very good for strength and be decent enough for hypertrophy .
the hypertrophy session can be in the 7 - 10 rep range which all very good for hypertrophy and decent enough for strength .
volume difference from the research available it be generally agree upon that we want to train with as much volume as we can recover from to maximize hypertrophy .
this do not necessarily mean we need to increase volume throughout a mesocycle .
high volume train contributes massively to fatigue level .
so we ca not have the volume too high otherwise our top end strength will be limit by fatigue level .
we will not effectively be able to train for strength .
this seem like a conundrum , how do we reconcile these two seemingly contradictory condition ?
diminish return , which we discuss at the start .
if the maximal amount of hypertrophy occurs at 100 percent volume , you may get 85 percent hypertrophy at 65 percent volume .
this 65 percent volume will lead to noticeably less fatigue .
if it be distribute intelligently over the week this will allow you to get a significant majority of the hypertrophy available .
it will also minimally impact your top end strength work .
this still allow you to drive your low rep range strength up due to lower fatigue level .
design hybrid strength and hypertrophy mesocycles i recently publish an article on the negative of train with high volume .
at the end of that article i briefly give some main consideration that you should abide by when create hybrid strength and hypertrophy mesocycles .
i will break it down in more detail here so you know how to structure your own hybrid strength and hypertrophy training .
consideration these be the consideration i post in my other article link above .
volume should be moderate .
the week will be asymmetrical in term of stress .
the heavy strength day should be at the very start of the week .
the middle / early end of the week should be more volume focus .
the end of the week should be easy to recover from so you be pretty fresh for the heavy day ( whether this be from easy workout or more rest day ) .
the volume ( set count ) in each week should be relatively constant .
the exception be the end of the final week of the block .
you can increase volume here since there be a deload come up .
volume volume ca not be too high or too low .
volume that be too high come with significant amount of fatigue that will affect your top end strength .
heavy strength base volume ( 80 - 85 percent ) also tend to be more difficult to recover from than moderate volume due to the sheer load be use .
if the volume be too low you simply will not have enough volume to stimulate hypertrophy at a reasonable rate if you be fairly advanced .
recently there be be a lot of debate on whether increase volume throughout a training mesocycle be optimal for hypertrophy .
i have try both keep volume ( in term of hard set ) constant and increase them slowly throughout a mesocycle .
it be hard to say if increasing volume through a mesocycle be well for hypertrophy .
i have find success increase it very slowly .
it be easy to increase too fast and run yourself into the ground .
i do not think your body adapts to a give volume level quickly enough to justify quicker increase in volume .
an increase from say 10 set of chest to 16 throughout a training block be probably overkill and can even hold back your long term progress .
rapid volume progression definitely be not the way to go with hybrid training .
the fatigue from rapid set increase will absolutely hinder how much you can lift on your strength base day .
i find increase myo rep cluster throughout a mesocycle for small easy to recover isolation movement to be the best way to increase volume over a mesocycle .
the fatigue increase from this be minimal .
it may take you from 10 set to 11/12 throughout a mesocycle use only movement that be easy to recover from .
this can also be do on hybrid program as the fatigue be minimal .
the cluster could even be increase at an even slow rate such as every other week .
in the final week of the mesocycle , even on main compound volume can be increase slightly in the second half of the week .
this be because the strength base work have already be complete , and there be a deload come up to drop any extra fatigue generate .
asymmetrical stress you need to be relatively fresh with minimal fatigue on your strength base day .
we need a certain amount of volume to drive hypertrophy , but it need to be place in a way that it do not disrupt your heavy day too much .
the goal should be increase performance on all day from week to week .
at the very least it should be increase on your strength base day if it be hold constant ( in the short term ) on your more volume focus day .
let take an example of an upper / lower split to make thing simple .
this could be accomplish by train heavy upper and low on day 1 and 2 respectively .
moderate upper low on day 4 and 5 respectively .
have day 3,6 and 7 as rest day .
keep volume ( in term of hard set ) the same on both day would give you an extra rest day for each muscle group before the strength day .
this be fine .
you can still get enough volume and intensity on the moderate day to stimulate hypertrophy .
with high frequency this can still be do , you just have to think a bit more .
for example if you be train a muscle 3x a week .
such as train the pressing muscle on day 1,3 and 5 , you may divide the set roughly equally but bias day 1 and 5 a bit .
7 set on day 1 and 5 , 6 set on day 3. day 1 would be the strength base day , day 3 and 5 would be more volume focus .
day 3 would include movement that favor short muscle length , so that there be minimal / no soreness / muscle damage for day 5. day 5 may have movement that stress long muscle length which lead to a bit more stimulation and soreness .
due to the 50 percent extra recovery time you can still recover in time for next week be day 1. this can be do with even high frequency , you just need to keep the general principle here in mind .
mesocycle design i be go to use the example above of a 4x a week upper low split and show how i would design the upper body day throughout a mesocycle .
i do not want to make this article obscenely long so i will just show the upper body progression .
you can 100 percent get the concept from what i be go to show you without the low body aspect .
do not get too attach to the specific exercise variation , set and weight use .
this be a super generic training block .
the idea be to just show how thing progress throughout the course of a mesocycle .
the main point to take away be that : the weight and rpe ( proximity to failure ) increase slightly every week .
volume ( hard set ) stay constant for the main compound ( no set change from week to week bar deload ) .
volume increase very slowly for less fatiguing isolation in the form of myo rep cluster .
this be not mandatory , they can be keep constant as well .
there be slight undulation throughout the week in term of load use .
there be enough variation in load to gain the benefit of daily undulating periodisation ( dup ) .
average rep range for compound be around 7 rep per set , and be high for isolation in the form of myo reps. on the heavy day bar the deload , most of the load use in the compound will be in the 77.5 - 87.5 percent range .
this be great for strength .
the rep be also high enough to be effective per set for hypertrophy ( there be not many set below 5 rep ) .
the isolation in the form of myo rep be light enough to ensure you be still target the correct muscle ( would be hard to do lateral raise and target the side delts with set of 6 ) .
on the strength base day the myos be just heavy enough to get a small strength stimulus ( think that be not the main purpose of isolation lift ) .
they be still in an appropriate rep range for hypertrophy .
on the strength day when do multiple set not every set have to be in the rpe range .
early set can be slightly below the target rpe to accumulate less fatigue .
the final set should always be in the range to ensure you be not too far from failure .
conclusion as long as you take into consideration the information in this article you can program for strength and hypertrophy at the same time .
you will not 100 percent optimise either but will get the best of both world , which i believe be what plenty of lifter actually want .
i find it to be a more enjoyable way to train as well .
< END > < START > conventional wisdom suggest that your pathway to success in the gym be narrow and linear .
if you want to get strong , you have to train for strength .
want to build muscle ?
hypertrophy have to be your only priority .
while this may be more true than false , especially the high you climb on your fitness journey , the reality be not as black - and - white .
powerlifters could learn a thing or two from their pose - trunk - clad colleague , and bodybuilder should not shy away from strength .
man perform standard back squat in gym if you want to enjoy the best of both world , you will need a handy guide to light your way .
here be how to mix powerlifting with bodybuilding and actually pull it off .
combine powerlifting and bodybuilding like most type of program design , there be more than one way to skin the cat .
if you want to mold your powerlifting workout to accommodate some pump work , or want to bodybuild while also get strong , your best bet be to develop an understanding of the principle at play .
do : decide your priority combine the two sport do not necessarily mean double your workload or perform both in equal measure .
instead , you should clearly define which of the two will be your “ primary ” focus .
decide whether you want to supplement your powerlifting training with bodybuilding , or vice versa , and proceed accordingly .
do not : stretch yourself thin once you have figure out which of the two will be your main focus , remember to program accordingly .
if you attempt to cover all the base in either sport or run two full routine in tandem , you might stretch or overwork yourself .
mix two style of training be all about manage your volume , effort , and expectation equally .
do : utilize different equipment mix up your training be the perfect time to dabble in different equipment .
if you be primarily a powerlifter who want to add some physique work to your training , you have a prime opportunity to utilize dumbbell , kettlebells , or cable during your accessory exercise .
conversely , if you bodybuild , train like a powerlifter will help acclimate you to the rigor of heavy barbell training in a way you may not already be familiar with .
do not : stray too far from the barbell no matter how you be go to organize your combined training , remember to include the barbell in at least some portion of your weekly regime .
barbell work can serve as the bridge between powerlifting and bodybuilding .
for powerlifters , it be a necessary facet of the sport .
for bodybuilder , barbell training be often the bedrock of both classic and modern muscle - building routine .
do : continue to compete you should continue to compete in powerlifting even if you be mix in some bodybuilding work .
regular competition , even if you “ train through ” them ( as in , not specifically peak for a performance on the day ) , keep you in tune with the atmosphere of a powerlifting meet .
on the other hand , a bodybuilder may not be able to properly prep for a show while train like a powerlifter , especially if they be not diet down .
however , there be no mandate that you show up at every physique competition peel to the bone .
do not : have unrealistic expectation whether you choose to compete while mix modality , you should keep your expectation in check .
most athlete , whether they train for strength or size , will perform at their best if they focus squarely on one or two specific goal .
as such , you should not necessarily expect to hit a lifetime personal record in the squat if a third of your training involve isolated hypertrophy work .
do : focus on nutrition diversify your training be no excuse to let yourself be lazy about nutrition .
powerlifters need to stay on top of their intake if they want to make a specific weight class .
bodybuilder must track their nutrition to cut down for a show or bulk up in the off - season .
therefore , it be just as important to be mindful of your eat habit even if you be not specifically work towards a weight or body composition - related goal .
do not : aim for perfection it be essential that you not get in your own way when you combine powerlifting and bodybuilding .
while you may be able to make significant gain after you acclimate to your new program , thing will likely feel a bit rocky in the beginning .
as long as you be enjoy your workout , the gain will follow .
do : periodize your training although powerlifters and bodybuilder have different approach to structure their training , both rely on some form of periodization .
if you decide to add one to the other , you should still periodize your workout to ensure that your training be structure and productive .
competitive powerlifter prepares to unrack squat attempt haphazardly throw bodybuilding work into your routine be a good way to run into a plateau or induce unwanted level of fatigue .
do not : try to peak it may seem obvious , but you should not try to peak if you be mix bodybuilding into your powerlifting training or vice - versa .
a powerlifter who be go heavy on accessory work may have too much fatigue accumulate from bodybuilding work to properly peak for heavy single - rep set .
similarly , too much heavy barbell work could make you too tire to effectively focus on your subsequent bodybuilding movement .
sample workout for combine powerlifting and bodybuilding the hard part of combine two different modality be ensure that the two style of train work synergistically .
you do not want your powerlifting work to negatively impact your bodybuilding exercise , or vice - versa .
fortunately , the best way to mix the two discipline be more straightforward than you might think .
here be a general overview : powerlifting focus add hypertrophy work to your powerlifting routine be easy .
all you will need to do be dial back a little bit on your sport - specific training while still put it first chronologically and philosophically .
for example , a “ low body ” strength train workout with some leg hypertrophy build in might look something like this : back squat : 5 x 3 deficit speed pull : 6 x 2 hip thrust : 3 x 8 walk lunge : 2 x 10 step per leg leg extension machine : 2 x 15 this kind of workout put the most important and technical exercise at the front , ensure that you get high - quality practice in .
afterward , you can expand your horizon with different equipment and auxiliary movement that be well suit for grow your wheel .
note : if you follow a template program for powerlifting , you should be able to transplant the set - rep progression for your competition movement into a “ hybrid ” routine .
pay attention to how it affect your overall training quality and fatigue level .
bodybuilding focus get strong while build your body be all about balance your fatigue .
your training will generally look similar to that of a powerlifter who add bodybuilding work , but your specific workout should have a tight focus than , say , “ pull ” or “ low body .
” for example : rack or block pull : 8 x 3 kroc row : 3 x 6 wide - grip lat pulldown : 3 x 8 , 12 , 15 dumbbell pullover : 3 x 12 - 15 face pull : 2 x 15 - 20 this back workout will torch your lat , trap , and erectors , but it also help you develop your deadlift lockout and general pull power .
more importantly , your bodybuilding workout should be just that — center around build your body .
the bench press , squat , and deadlift ( or their many variation ) should accompany the same body part you be hit on that day .
you might find it difficult to properly train your chest for mass if you start your workout with heavy back squat .
method you can look beyond individual workout and toward your overall training week if you want to combine powerlifting with bodybuilding as well .
one alternative method of combination program design involve dedicate one day solely to powerlifting or strength - specific work , and then perform a physique - focus workout on a separate day .
for example , this two - day leg train scheme put that idea into practice : day one ( strength focus ) back squat : 5 x 5 deadlift : 3 x 3 good morning : 2 x 10 weighted plank : 2 x 30 second day two ( hypertrophy focus ) front squat : 6 x 3 romanian deadlift : 3 x 6 , 8 , 12 bulgarian split squat : 3 x 8 - 10 leg extension : 2 x 15 leg curl : 2 x 15 calf raise : 3 x 15 you be still train legs twice per week .
in fact , you be also squat twice to ensure high - quality skill development .
the key difference be that both workout have a distinct and clear focus , and should also “ feel ” quite different from each other .
the first session be par - for - the - course powerlifting , while the subsequent workout train a variation of the competitive back squat and then hammer your leg with all manner of accessory work .
benefit of combine powerlifting and bodybuilding you might not get as strong as a career powerlifter who only care about their total .
in the same vein , full - time physique development be probably the best way to bulk up .
however , there be some unique benefit to mix your method and dabble in both powerlifting and bodybuilding simultaneously .
big muscle be strong muscle there be a synergistic relationship between muscular cross - sectional area ( which be to say , how jacked you be ) and strength potential .
if you remove other factor like technical efficiency , train experience , or fatigue , a big muscle will be strong than a small one .
( 1 ) ( 2 ) muscle reduces injury risk there be no foolproof way of 100 percent eliminate the risk of injury in the gym .
luckily , strength training be not particularly injurious , especially when compare to ballistic exercise or contact sport .
( 3 ) however , add muscle to your frame may help reduce the risk of injury or sport - related accident in the gym , at least partially .
( 4 ) strength help you grow powerlifting be all about teach you to push your limit .
after all , you ca not casually set a new 1 - rep max .
as such , the sport - specific demand of powerlifting might also help you be a good bodybuilder .
there be a dose and , particularly , effort - response relationship between resistance training and hypertrophy .
put simply , the long you have be in the gym , the harder you will need to work to grow .
( 5 ) high - intensity strength training will teach you to apply effort across the board , instead of sandbag your “ small ” isolation exercise .
more novelty to your workout dedicate and focus programming be a fantastic way to hit a specific goal .
on the other hand , strict periodization — whether you be try to add pound to your bar or inch to your arm — be monotonous by nature .
if repetitive workout tend to make you feel bore or burn out , mix up your method can remedy the issue and keep you move forward at the same time .
there be no harm in enjoy variety in the gym .
your takeaway to succeed at the absolute high level of any athletic discipline , you will probably have to specialize .
bar that , it be both possible ( and potentially beneficial ) to combine powerlifting and bodybuilding into one comprehensive training plan .
understand that you will not be able to perform both as well as if you would focus solely on either .
keep the barbell in the limelight , but do not be afraid to experiment with non - sport - specific exercise while you can .
if you be a strength or physique athlete , it might be wise to compete casually during period of combination training .
put your strength work first during your workout , or dedicate an entire day to it exclusively .
the physiological effect of combination training can benefit you whether you prefer powerlifting or bodybuilding .
big muscle be strong muscle , and the musculoskeletal stimulation of bodybuilding can make you a more robust and resilient strength specialist .
strength , size , and a whole lot more if you follow bodybuilding , you might notice a recent trend — a lot of the top athlete be not afraid to lift heavy in the gym .
many , in fact , credit max - effort training as a boon to their physique development .
conversely , the modern powerlifter be not afraid to look the part .
many of the strong athlete in the world be jack out of their mind , and rightly so .
do this mean that they all mix training style ?
not necessarily .
be successful powerlifters and bodybuilder afraid to borrow and learn from one another ?
absolutely not .
you would be wise to follow in their footstep — your total , and your physique , will thank you .
< END > < START > running be one of the most popular sport in boulder , colorado with many individual take advantage of our many trail option .
in general , run workout can focus on short duration , high intensity sprint perform as interval or long duration , sustain low to moderate intensity distance run .
each training option promote beneficial change in the body but new research highlight the benefit of sprint training in age runner .
previous research have focus on the benefit of long and slow distance running , but less attention have be pay to sprint training .
in a recent review article and colleague discuss the beneficial adaption of sprint training especially among age runner ( exercise and sport science review 2015 ) .
in comparison to endurance athlete , sprint athlete have a slow rate of decline in maximum heart rate , one of the main factor in calculate vo2 max or the maximal amount of oxygen the body can utilize each minute .
thus sprint athlete show a small decline in vo2 max over time compare to their endurance training peer .
sprint athlete train at high intensity require faster , more explosive muscle contraction .
these contraction promote muscle hypertrophy in sprinter compare to their endurance training peer .
thus it be not surprising sprint athlete have a slow decline in lean muscle mass due to age compare to endurance athlete .
in addition , sprint athlete demonstrate good performance on power , agility , and jump task compare to their endurance train peer .
one final benefit of sprint training be exercise adherence .
sprint athlete have good adherence to their exercise program likely secondary to their workout be less time consume and more efficient than long , slow endurance program .
runner be encourage to consider implement sprint or interval workout into their exist endurance program to far improve their health and performance .
< END > < START > whether you be pound the street , hit the track , or jump on a treadmill , there be no doubt that run be one of the most popular form of exercise .
accord to the sport & fitness industry association , around 50 million people in the us participate in some running or jogging exercise – that be 15 percent of the entire population .
but be it the best way to lose weight ?
you probably do not have endless time to exercise , so if weight loss be your goal , you want to know what will give you the most bang for your buck .
long distance run so , if you enjoy run and want to make this part of your exercise routine , be long - distance run or sprint best ?
long - distance run vs sprinting : what be the difference ?
first , figure out the difference between long - distance running and sprint before go far .
what be long - distance run ?
many people think of long - distance run as marathon and cross - country race , which certainly count as long - distance running , but it do not have to be long .
anything that involve run for two mile or more can be consider long - distance .
it require stamina , aerobic endurance , and mental toughness .
it be the chosen run for those with more time on their hand and who enjoy take time out to reset their body and mind .
what be sprint ?
sprinting be run flat over a short distance so that you be anaerobic and finish the exercise out of breath .
it be an all - out effort design to test your lung to their maximum capacity .
the benefit of sprint include improvement in speed , blood pressure , and cardiovascular health .
this should be an exercise you can complete in under 30 second .
the idea be that you will recover afterward and repeat several time .
the recovery time between group will depend on how fit you be , but ideally , it should give you enough time to get your breathe back to relative normality , between 1.5 and 2 minute be ideal .
long - distance run vs sprinting : which help you lose more weight ?
there be an argument for both discipline , for sure .
both long - distance and sprint be exercise that will get you move , and your body will know it be be in a workout at the end , so there be plenty to suggest that both will burn enough calorie to make a marked improvement in body composition .
be long - distance run good for weight loss ?
when you think about lose weight , long - distance running be probably one of the first place your mind go .
after all , you do not see many overweight long - distance runner – so it must work .
however , it be not always the most effective way to burn calorie , especially consider the time it take .
as a general rule , an average - sized runner will burn about 100 calorie per mile .
so , if you want to burn 500 calorie , you need to run around 5 mile .
at an average pace , five mile would take around 50 minute to run , although realistically , it would take you long if you be new to run .
so , theoretically , you could burn load of calorie and be in a calorie deficit , but only if you have lot of time to run .
long - distance running be a great way to get your muscle move at a speed that suit you , get your heart rate up and build strength and endurance .
if you be new to exercise , your body increase its sensitivity to insulin , which mean you can use carbohydrate more efficiently and burn fat .
this mean that , to begin with , long - distance running could be an effective way to lose weight .
however , your body be just too damn clever ; over time , it adapt to whatever new stress be throw at it and the stimulus become more effortless .
this mean that eventually you will burn few calorie over the same distance , and hard it will be to lose weight .
plus , long - distance run can leave you feel starve afterward .
the temptation to eat more sugary or high - cal food as a treat need to be avoid .
otherwise , you be cancel out the workout .
when be long - distance run good for weight loss ?
if you be new to exercise or live a sedentary lifestyle , jog or long - distance running be an effective way to lose weight .
however , this will taper off once your body adapts , and fat and weight loss will plateau .
be sprint good for weight loss short burst of sprint be over so quickly that you might not realize just how great they can be for burn calorie and fat .
a 2019 study conclude that high - intensity sprint interval training result in a 28.5 percent high fat reduction .
you can burn up to 500 calorie by run 10 x 100 - meter sprint , and the entire session will take around twenty minute , which be perfect to incorporate into a busy schedule .
however , warm up be still essential .
go from zero to full speed from a cold start will put immense pressure on your joint , muscle , and heart .
it be vital to take up your heart rate progressively .
start with some stretch and star jump .
make sure you be work your hamstring and quad ( gently , of course- do not put massive pressure on them during the warm - up ) .
when be sprint good for weight loss ?
sprinting be excellent for weight loss and be most likely one of the most effective exercise you can do .
however , it be high - intensity and put great stress on your body – so it be not something beginner will likely be able to do immediately .
long distance run vs. sprinting : how to get start if you want to get start with long - distance run or sprint , then the best way be to progress slowly .
whether you intend to concentrate on high or low - intensity workout , you need to get your body use to what you will be ask it to do .
even if you be in decent enough shape , a new discipline such as run will use new muscle group , so it be essential to ease yourself in .
if you go at it too hard and fast in the early week , you will risk cause yourself an injury and set yourself off - course .
in the first week or two , try some slow , easy run .
keep your breathe steady throughout the run and if you feel you be get out of breath , slow down or stop .
once you can comfortably run three mile , it be time to ramp thing up .
long - distance run vs sprint : at the end of each session , try eight to ten stride .
these short , fast session aim to get your heart rate up and prepare you for more intense workout .
the aim be not to sprint “ all out ” ; you move comfortably and with speed .
stride be vital whether you intend to take sprinting or long - distance route long - term .
once you have adjust your body to the rigor of run and it have become familiar , you will be ready to progress to the next stage .
ideally , allow three or four week of these long easy run before move to the next level .
if you be new to sprinting , try eight to ten sprint per session , and increase gradually as you get strong .
the key to burn calorie be not the number of set ; it be the intensity of the sprint , so that should be your primary focus .
as the week and month progress , you can increase the intensity by reduce the recovery time between rep and add gradient , so you run slightly uphill .
you can perform this exercise on a treadmill or outdoors , but the latter be preferable .
should you run long - distance or sprint ?
if you be manage your calorie intake efficiently , there be no deny that you could lose weight through steady , long - distance run .
however , it can be a tricky and time - consuming process .
in comparison , high - intensity sprint can be perform in less time and burn more calorie than slow long - distance jog .
you will also find you will not encounter the kind of sugary craving at the end of your workout you would in the long run .
the bonus be that your body will continue to burn fat even after the exercise due to your raise heart rate .
winner : high - intensity sprint be the way forward .
so long as you be manage your calorie intake efficiently , you will find they be a giant stride forward in your weight loss goal .
< END > < START > once a workout be over and you be back in your daily routine , your body be metabolism can continue to burn more calorie then when at complete rest .
this physiological effect be call excess post - exercise oxygen consumption also know as oxygen debt , epoc be the amount of oxygen require to restore your body to its normal , rest level of metabolic function ( call homeostasis ) .
it also explain how your body can continue to burn calorie long after you have finish your workout .
your metabolism be how your body convert the nutrient you consume in your diet to adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) , the fuel your body use for muscular activity .
atp be produce either with oxygen use the aerobic pathway or without oxygen rely on the anaerobic pathway .
when you first start to exercise , your body use the anaerobic energy pathway and store atp to fuel that activity .
a proper warm - up be important because it can take about five to eight minute to be able to efficiently use aerobic metabolism to produce the atp necessary to sustain physical activity .
once a steady - state of oxygen consumption be achieve , the aerobic energy pathway be able to provide most of the atp need for the workout .
exercise that place a great demand on the anaerobic energy pathway during the workout can increase the need for oxygen after the workout , thereby enhance the epoc effect .
here be seven thing you should know about epoc and how it can help you achieve optimal level of calorie burn from your workout .
To note , hiit be High intensity interval training , ATP be Adenosine Triphosphate , epoc be Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption , VO2 be Volume Oxygen Consumption .
: 1. during the immediate post - exercise recovery period , oxygen be use for the following function : production of atp to replace the atp use during the workout re - synthesis of muscle glycogen from lactate restore oxygen level in venous blood , skeletal muscle blood and myoglobin work with protein for the repair of muscle tissue damage during the workout restore body temperature to resting level 2. exercise that consume more oxygen burn more calorie the body expend approximately 5 calorie of energy ( a calorie be the amount of energy require to heat 1 liter of water 1 degree centigrade ) to consume 1 liter of oxygen .
therefore , increase the amount of oxygen consume both during and after a workout can increase the number of net calorie burn .
3. circuit training and heavy resistance training with short rest interval require atp from the anaerobic pathway , lead to a significant epoc effect strength training with compound , multi - joint weightlifting exercise or do a weightlift circuit that alternate between upper- and low - body movement place a great demand on the involved muscle for atp from the anaerobic pathway .
increase need for anaerobic atp also create a great demand on the aerobic system to replenish that atp during the rest interval and the post - exercise recovery process .
heavy training load or short recovery interval increase the demand on the anaerobic energy pathway during exercise , which yield a great epoc effect during the post - exercise recovery period .
4. high - intensity interval training ( hiit ) be the most effective way to stimulate the epoc effect the body be most efficient at produce atp through aerobic metabolism ; however , at high intensity when energy be need immediately , the anaerobic pathway can provide the necessary atp much more quickly .
this be why we can only sustain high - intensity activity for a brief period of time — we simply run out of energy .
hiit work because atp be produce by the anaerobic pathway during high - intensity exercise ; once that atp be exhaust , it be necessary to allow atp to be replenish .
the rest interval or active - recovery period during an anaerobic workout allow aerobic metabolism to produce and replace atp in the involved muscle .
the oxygen deficit be the difference between the volume of oxygen consume during exercise and the amount that would be consume if energy demand be meet through only the aerobic energy pathway .
5. epoc be influence by the intensity , not the duration of exercise high intensity require atp from anaerobic pathway .
if the atp require to exercise at a particular intensity be not obtain aerobically , it must com3e from the anaerobic pathway .
during epoc , the body use oxygen to restore muscle glycogen and rebuild muscle protein damage during exercise .
even after a hiit workout be over , the body will continue to use the aerobic energy pathway to replace the atp consume during the workout , thus enhance the epoc effect .
6. research have show that resistance training can provide a great epoc effect than run at a steady speed in an extensive review of the research literature on epoc , study conclude that “ study in which similar estimate energy cost or similar exercise vo2 have be use to equate continuous aerobic exercise and intermittent resistance exercise , have indicate that resistance exercise produce a great epoc response .
” for example , one study find that when aerobic cycling ( 40 minute at 80 percent max hr ) , circuit weight training ( 4 sets/8 exercises/15 rep at 50 percent 1 - rm ) and heavy resistance exercise ( 3 sets/8 exercise at 80 - 90 percent 1 - rm to exhaustion ) be compare , heavy resistance exercise produce the big epoc .
7. the epoc effect from a hiit or high - intensity strength - training workout can add 6 to 15 percent of the total energy cost of the exercise session high - intensity workouts require more energy from the anaerobic pathway and can generate a great epoc effect , lead to extend post - exercise energy expenditure .
heavy weight training and hiit workout appear to be superior to steady - state running or low - intensity circuit training in create epoc ( , withers and , 2006 ) .
admittedly there be some debate about the significance of the epoc effect for the average exercise participant because the high - intensity exercise require for epoc can be extremely challenging .
however , if you want result and be up for the challenge , increase the intensity of your workout by use heavy weight , short rest interval or high - intensity cardio interval may be worth the effort .
while hiit or heavy resistance training be effective and beneficial , remember to allow at least 48 hour of recovery time between high - intensity exercise session and try to limit yourself to no more than three strenuous workout per week .
if you do start increase the intensity of your workout to boost epoc , consider add these recovery strategy .
< END > < START > distance runner from the 5k to the marathon have no shortage of option to guide training decision while peak for that next big race .
many program provide interval workout to challenge the aerobic pathway need to hammer a chosen race distance whether that be a 5k or full - on 26.2 marathon distance .
these interval workout be all incredibly valuable at prepare runner for grind out the effort to hit that next pr ( personal record ) , while an overlooked and undervalued training adaptation for distance runner be develop pure sprint speed .
study have prove that sprint speed be a predictor of top performance in distance run event .
sprint improves run economy by make your top speed faster , which mean that when you get faster , the pace you run that felt hard before feel less hard .
on top of that , sprint session be downright fun !
while run track in high school , i envy the sprinter who run for a few second , and stand around for what seem like eternity .
here , we will dive into why you should add sprint to your training plan and give you some way to fit sprint into your weekly mileage without sacrifice volume .
why you should add sprint training session sprint training can provide train benefit beyond just add variety to your routine .
as and , md make clear in their book the happy runner , “ run economy be influence by biomechanics , neuromuscular circuitry , and aerobic development .
” run economy be define as the energy demand for a give velocity of sub - maximal running or how hard a runner have to work at a give speed below their top speed .
the theoretical benefit of sprint training as a mean to increase your run economy to improve distance run result be simple .
get faster at your top speed , and your speed at less than top speed follow .
sprint training be the most efficient way to improve the biomechanics and neuromuscular circuitry for improve your top speed .
if you want to run faster , you must run faster .
as the roche be also write in their book , and i can speak from my personal experience , runner tend to focus too much on aerobic development .
accord to a study publish in the international journal of sport physiology and performance , researcher find significant correlation between both 5k and 10k season best time with both 100 m and 400 m sprint time .
however , they find no relationship between the aforementioned race result and vo2 max there be some limitation to this study as it apply to broader population .
the study have a small sample size of 12 male athlete who be also national top - level athlete .
conversely , they also do not test any correlation of sprint speed to race distance longer than the 10k .
with that , it seem entirely possible that we be not consider the adaptation that sprint training can have amongst the broad spectrum of ability within the run community or amongst the range of race distance popular in the running community .
with sprint training , we place a high emphasis on build our run economy .
also in the happy runner , the roche be point out an example where researcher test ( world record holder in the marathon ) vo2 max in 1991 when she be a teenager at 70ml / min / kg , and in annual test thereafter mark no observable improvement while she get immensely faster .
the author surmise that “ be run economy improve about 15 percent , so she do too .
” since a vo2max test measure the amount of oxygen the body use while at max effort , the test can indicate an athlete be aerobic capacity , yet have limitation in assess the full capability for any individual .
with an understanding of aerobic capacity and the correlation run economy can play in the development of faster aerobic race result , it become clear that incorporate speed session to an endurance training plan of any distance will drive result .
this improvement affect any athlete , at any training level , by simply raise your max speed ceiling .
one of the simple reason to add sprint training session to your weekly mileage be variety .
run creates compound stress on the same muscle group , but it can also be mentally challenge to run the same rout week - in and week - out .
if an athlete be train within a demand work / life schedule , they will prioritize convenience to ensure they meet their weekly volume quota .
this can mean run the same loop close to home or work repeatedly not only throughout a week , but sometimes within the same daily run session .
add sprint session can give the athlete a new challenge , and be an easy way to add intensity to a training plan .
another bonus be that with sprinting , there be no need for any extra equipment , just a surface long enough to cover the required session distance .
how and when to add sprint training session there be many way that sprint session can be add to your weekly training plan .
most training plan include stride at the end of one of the shorter session , so some sprint work be already be add to most athlete weekly mileage .
however , to see the great adaptation to sprint work a more strategic and thoughtful approach will improve sprint performance far .
in a 2015 study publish in the journal of strength and conditioning research that look at over 1400 subject , across 48 previous study , find that specific sprint training method improve the speed of athlete for all distance .
for distance runner , the goal should be to train both acceleration and maximal velocity .
one method for add sprint session to a training plan be to schedule one to two session per week during an athlete be base build phase , preferably by replace the stride session if those be part of the training plan .
i suggest incorporate the sprint session at the beginning of the training session after an adequate warm - up .
by invert the day be plan , you give the athlete the opportunity to give the most quality to the component of training which be most beneficial .
in a well design training session , sequence should see speed and power unit ahead of any strength and endurance unit .
so if an athlete be plan on a general aerobic or slow pace run on a training day , prioritize the speed session at the beginning to gain the most value out of the day be session .
in other word , do the high priority and harder stuff first .
if an athlete be already do strength session in the gym during a training cycle , short sprint session can be add to these workout .
as long as overall training volume be take into consideration , add a quality sprint component to the beginning of a gym session , where an athlete be work on other power component , can be an effective method .
this tend to stack the session that induce the most tissue damage in the same day to allow for adequate recovery time .
be sure to monitor the athlete if use this training approach .
each athlete be different , and add too much to an individual session can cause overload .
it be well to do a little bit of that high quality work if more be go to sacrifice overall training quality .
listen to the athlete and adjust as necessary .
follow the session sequence from above with speed and power before strength and endurance .
that mean begin the session with sprint work before get into any strength work for the day .
a third place to add a short sprint session to a training plan be during what be know as a quota day .
a quota day be typically a shorter , easy run at the end of a week that an athlete us to fulfill weekly mileage quota .
these typically fall the day after a long run , and two day before a quality interval session .
the timing suggestion for add these sprint session be to ensure a full day of recovery from any other hard session prior to and directly follow the workout .
this ensure full recovery before a workout that induce heavy tissue damage .
again , follow the sequencing as if you be add these to base building run where the sprint session be include at the beginning of a run .
it be all about priority and make sure you do not come into a sprint session with per - fatigue muscle and risk injury .
speed training option there be two different sprint skill that require training , and they have different session characteristic .
those skill be acceleration , or the ability to gain speed in a short amount of time , and maximal velocity , or the high possible sprint speed you can achieve .
to train for acceleration , you can use a variety of method that include short distance sprint acceleration , resist run , or hill sprint .
the goal should be to keep each repetition at or under 30 m and to allow for around 1 minute of rest for each 10 m of sprint or 1:20 to 1:40 work to rest ratio .
total volume for a session should not exceed 300 m and take into consideration athlete experience level , total training volume , and time constraint .
acceleration workout session : perform the following set and rep at a max effort level , and use a two point start position .
a two point start position be start with both foot on the ground in a stance similar to a football wide receiver prior to the snap .
for athlete with injury history or return from injury , use a “ drop - in ” to start ( a skip into the sprint start ) to reduce the force of start from stand .
5 time at 10 m w/ 1 minute rest 2 minute rest then into 4 time at 20 m w/ 2 minute rest 4 time at 30 m w/ 2 minute rest to train for maximal velocity , you can use method that include assisted sprint , fly start , and sprint - float - sprint .
the goal should be to keep each repetition at or under 60 m and to allow for between 2 to 4 minute of rest between rep or 1:20 to 1:40 work to rest ratio .
total volume for a session should not exceed 300 m. maximal velocity workout session : 6 time at 15 m fly sprint with 30 m run - in w/ 2 minute rest sprint training can seem like an incredibly daunt world to venture into for endurance athlete , but it do not have to be complex to be effective .
as study have prove , this can be one of the most beneficial training session for endurance athlete at all level .
it require very little time and even less equipment .
just start small and build these session into your training plan as the body adapts .
most importantly , have fun with it .
run really fast on a field or a track will make you feel like a pro athlete , and it beat run that same neighborhood loop for the billionth time .
more importantly , it will make you a fast runner and run fast be essentially the goal whether that be over a distance of 100 meter or 100 mile .
so , get out there and channel your inner usain bolt .
who know , maybe you be a sprinter all along .
< END > < START > a runner be typical week of training involve workout at a variety of pace , range from slow , easy run for recovery and basic aerobic endurance to threshold effort and race - pace interval to build fitness for a specific race distance .
but perhaps the least - used pace in the average runner be train be the fast one — sprint training .
while some runner include a couple of stride once a week to keep in touch with their speed , do true sprint workout on a regular basis be not very popular .
while this might make sense , as only the last hundred meter or so of a distance race involve actually sprint , the usefulness of train all - out speed nevertheless merit some scientific investigation .
can sprint train substitute hard work ?
sprint train get something of a bad rap as a shortcut for quick result .
this be somewhat deserved , give the amount of people tout it as a total replacement for old - fashion hard work .
give what we already know from the collective wisdom of thousand of runner put in traditional training over many year , sprint training will never be a true replacement for easy running , aerobic workout , and race - specific work , but could prove to be a useful addition to our train regimen , depend on what the science say .
while there have be plenty of study on the use of sprint training ( narrowly define here as short , high - intensity interval at speed well over that of your usual race distance ) in untrained people , which usually show that these “ high - intensity interval training ” or hiit session be quite effective at get short - term result , we be only interested in the effect of sprint training in well - trained runner or endurance athlete .
instead of focus on whether sprint training be superior to any other kind , we should instead take note of what effect it have on fitness so we can predict when and how to integrate it into training .
sprint training and fitness their study investigate the muscular adaptation that occur in response to six session of sprint training ( 4 - 7 x 30 second all - out with four minute recovery ) spread out over two week .
use eight reasonably fit cyclist , they measure a variety of muscular parameter before and after the six interval training session , compare them to change in a control group which do not do any sprint training .
after the two - week training intervention , the cyclist show a significant increase in muscular marker for store and process fuel during exercise .
however , they have no change in their vo2 max , the amount of oxygen they use during exercise .
the performance of the cyclist in a ride - to - exhaustion improve dramatically as well , move from 26 minute until exhaustion to 51 minute .
the lack of improvement in vo2 max implies that most or all of the improvement in the rider fitness come from improvement in muscular efficiency and energy production , instead of the cardiovascular improvement observe when an athlete do traditional endurance training .
sprint training and performance the specific of how sprint training elicits improvement in the muscle be examine in more detail .
before and after seven train runner undergo a six - week train program of workout with 5 - 15 second sprint , they measure the level of biological marker of fast , anaerobic athletic performance in the athlete muscle .
like with study , the athlete show a significant improvement in time and distance cover over a run to exhaustion .
they link these improvement to increased level of a specific type of protein in the muscle call the monocarboxylate transporter 1 , or mct1 .
this protein function as a “ shuttle ” to move lactate in and out of your muscle during exercise , transport it from your leg to less - stress area where it can be reuse as fuel .
this could explain why short program of sprint training appear to have a positive impact on endurance performance , even without any improvement in aerobic fitness : by quickly remove metabolic byproduct from your muscle , you be able to sustain a high level of energy production over a long period of time .
biological effect increase level of one protein , however , be probably not the only important effect of sprint training .
in a 2002 review study , , , and at the university of cape town in south africa extensively examine the biological effect of high - intensity sprint training .
a range of study demonstrate increase in performance , accompany by high level of biological marker for anaerobic fitness , fatigue resistance , and power production , but many of these study use untrained individual .
among the study of well - train athlete , sprint training still elicit significant improvement in fitness , but most of the benefit be gain in the first six session of sprint training .
far bout of sprint - style interval workout result in small marginal benefit than the initial six or so , typically spread out over two or three week .
they speculate that highly trained athlete respond more selectively to sprint training than sedentary people : because their fitness be already well - develop , their adaptation to sprint training be mostly in the form of good energy production in the muscle and more efficient processing of metabolic byproduct like lactate .
sprint - style workout , like 7×30 second at near - maximum effort with plenty of recovery be quite different from standard workout for endurance in distance runner .
while these workout might seem like an attractive shortcut to fitness base on study of untrained individual , a well - train distance runner respond much more selectively .
how to incorporate sprint train into your schedule though sprint training can offer distance runner benefit in the form of good management of rise lactate level and high energy production in the muscle , it be not a replacement for the standard workouts that make up the bulk of your training .
to date , scientific research indicate that do around six session of high - intensity sprint training spread out over a few week will net you the big benefit associate with this type of training .
as with everything else in training , if you would like to integrate sprint workout into your routine : you should do it gradually — start with only a couple 15 - 30 second repeat , take ample time to recover between each .
over the course of several week , you could work your way up to more repeat .
do workout base solely on the testimony of a scientific paper can be a risky endeavor because physiology research be an inherently myopic field of study — benefit at four or six week be typically the focus , while long - term result and risk be give relatively less attention .
meaning , do not focus your training schedule on sprint training for a long period of time .
a quick 3 - 5 week segment , especially after a marathon , and a sprint session every few week can get you the benefit you need do not forget that sprint training will put a lot of stress on your body , give the extremely high speed associate with it , and could lead to overuse injury if you do not ease into it .
hopefully , this article provide insight into why sprint training be important and how it will eventually help your training in the long - term , even if you be a marathoner .
remember , develop top end speed take time , especially if you have never do it before .
be patient !

where yoga may be lack be where strength training seem to shine .
benefit of strength training strength training do the obvious – it enhance your muscle mass .
however , the benefit of strength training do not stop there .

about age – it be expect that as you age , you will start lose up to 5 percent of your lean muscle mass per year .
a recent study show that just 30 minute of strength training twice per week can counteract that .
there be a big movement happen that say strong be the new sexy .
i be not talk bodybuilder crazy muscle with the flexibility of a statue ( be that why they be so good at pose ? )
, but some definition and tone that show off your strength .
if you be after the “ sexy strong ” look , you ca not ignore the benefit of strength training .
but now we be practically at the complete opposite end of the workout spectrum from yoga .
what give ?
yoga and strength training be complementary yoga and strength training be like peanut butter and jelly – or lulu and messy bun .
they compliment each other so well because where one lack , the other shine , and vice versa .
yoga have a total mind - body effect that build and strengthen the longer you practice it .
strength training have the power to fill your life with vitality , especially as you age .
both have their place , but when combine , yoga and strength training offer a fully balance schedule that essentially double up the benefit you receive from your workout .
perk of practice both yoga and strength training when you accompany yoga with strength training , you unlock this beautiful partnership that have an overwhelming impact on your mental and physical health .
here be some of the perk you will notice when you practice both .
flexibility and strength building if you lift weight exclusively , you get the benefit of strength building .
however , that be often at the expense of flexibility .
when you combine yoga and strength training during your weekly routine , you get the benefit of both !
well breathe during your strength training workouts we have all be in that place where your body be under tension and you be hold your breath , wait for the release so we can huff and puff as we relax .
this be terrible form , but it can become a habit when you do not practice good breathing technique .
that be where yoga come in .
a huge component of yoga be control breathing , and by stay mindful about your breathing and employ the technique you have learn , you will double up on the muscle - building benefit .
muscle mass and endurance strength train give you the obvious benefit of increased muscle mass .
however , you can miss out on muscle endurance , and muscle flexibility .
fortunately , this be where yoga shine .
yoga offer muscle tone and endurance through its slow - move pose that force your body to hold position for extend period of time .
this not only will help you lift weight during your strength training session , but it extend to everyday life .
yep , even something as simple as get off the couch will become easier .
less chance of injury yoga be know to improve your range of motion while also encourage well posture .
while this will help you avoid back pain if you be sit at a desk all day , it also transfer to your strength training effort .
by add yoga into your weekly routine , you will be far less likely to suffer from a weight lift - related injury .
well range of motion around your joint – which yoga provide – will help you lift safely .
boost speed and power it be easy to start lag in a long yoga session , but strength training can really help .
do explosive movement like squat and plyometrics not only strengthen your core , but they develop muscle fiber .
these benefit will help reinforce your yoga pose while boost your speed and power as you move from stance to stance .
essentially , you will feel in great control of your body .
stress management as previously mention , yoga be a major stress reliever , which promote well emotional health .

< END > < START > we have all see the masterful acrobatics on instagram with people lift themselves into the most impressive of yoga pose and hold them for what seem an impossible amount of time .
anyone can see that take a lot of strength and control .
it may seem like yogi and weight trainer be two separate tribe , but as we seek out more diverse and balanced approach to strength training , could incorporate yoga into your training help you on your quest for strength ?
and if you be already on board with yoga , how can you make sure it be complement your strength training ?
each week three trainer from stylist strong , stylist be fitness brand that run strength - training class focus on incorporate weight into fitness , explain some of the most - ask question from woman who want to get into lifting .
this week they be explain the role yoga can play in strength training and way to make sure it be not work against you .
be yoga good for strength training ?
caroline bragg , master trainer at stylist strong “ yes , but it depend on what kind of yoga you be do and what kind of strength training you be do .
if we be talk about restorative yoga , that might not necessarily link in as much because that be much more about relaxation .
but if we be talk about it benefit what you be do in your strength class , i would say focus a bit more on slow or dynamic work , where you be work on mobility rather than stretch .
range of motion , or rom , be important to get the full range in our muscle .
so sometimes you see people squat and they ca not squat that low , and it be well to get that full range of motion in the squat or that full hip hinge , so something like yoga or pilate would be beneficial .
” “ if you be very flexible , then your muscle tend to be loose , and when you be strength training you kind of want your muscle to be tight .
so it be important to pick which yoga class you go to if you do want to include it in your exercise routine .
if you go to something like hatha or vinyasa where it be strengthen you , it be also mobilise and some people do need more mobility in their joint .
that will make them strong because it mean they can get into position more easily or into position that they could not get into before .
at stylist strong we have the strong yoga class , which be great , but if a class involve lot of stretch , then it be counterproductive to strength training .
something that people may want to be cautious of if they be go from a pure yoga background into strength training be their range of movement .
people who do yoga be incredibly flexible and have a lot of range .
they tend to come into position a little bit too far and they lose the tension in the muscle and then it become a bit more tendony and that be when you tend to get injury .
” “ it be definitely very good for strength training as a complementary thing , because yoga also build strength , just like weightlift do , but you be use your own body weight to develop strength .
it also develop spatial awareness in term of your body , your sense of balance .
you be also lengthen those muscle and increase your flexibility , which be a really good thing to do when you be also do weight / resistance training , because a lot of the exercise may be shorten your muscle or maybe you be not do adequate stretching after your session .
yoga be a great way to ensure you be still flexible and mobile so in term of your body mobility and range of motion , i definitely think yoga be a great thing to do alongside weight training .
what be a good balance for combine the two ?
“ strengthen with weight will help your yoga and yoga can help your strength training .
so , they go hand in hand : your exercise routine should have balance in it .
if all you be do be lot of strength training and not mobilise , your strength training be go to be limit .
and if you be just do yoga and not add in some strength training to get the stability you need in your joint , you be probably go to get injured .
you can get very strong [ with yoga ] but strength training aid that a little bit quicker .
so , if your goal be to do a handstand – if you be work on a press up and then work on some lat pull - down and some overhead press – you be go to have the stability in the shoulder and the strength through the shoulder to come into that handstand a lot quick than if you would just kind of practice fling yourself and hop that you can carry your body in a handstand .
“ i would suggest do about three strength session a week and focus them around big compound lift ; thing like your deadlift , your squat , overhead press , bench press , bent - over row , and then maybe do one yoga class a week would also be good .
that be four session a week , which be quite a lot .
but the yoga class would almost be like an active recovery class , so it be not too intense , to help your nervous system rest a little bit , but it keep the body move .
go for something like a sport massage be great , just nothing that be too vigorous and be go to create trauma .
what you want be someone who be just go to do long , gentle stroke to increase the blood flow .
and if you be do a flow - base yoga , you be get the same effect .
so if you be move pretty constantly in a class , vinyasa would be a good one for that , then you be increase that blood flow around the body , which be go to help ease up the muscle if you have get any soreness .
“ “ personally , i do not do yoga once a week simply because i do not have the time .
you can do yoga once a month , once a fortnight , or once a week .
i would go by how i feel because sometimes you want to take it slow .
do you want to move your body without have to lift weight because you want to have a low - impact recovery day ?
so , that be where you might take it easy – like a hatha yoga session .
that be how i do it .
i certainly would not do yoga more than once a week do yoga mentally benefit strength training ?
“ i really recommend yoga to people more so for the mental benefit than the physical .
that be what i say to people all the time ; i think it be great for them to do it , but to go there and not push their body , just really tap into the mind and focus on be as present as possible .
you can transfer that over into your strength training , because the strength training be probably go to be a little bit more taxing on the body .
but if you can stay in that mindset of be really present and focus on the task at hand , then that be a great way to be during any kind of training session .
yoga be really good at make you feel aware of any ache or pain or little niggles , and the teacher will tend to make you aware of them before you even start the class .
so from the get - go , you be just become very in touch with your body , which be great , especially for training .
some day you may not have warm up properly and the movement feel a bit sticky , so you do not want to add too much load on if it be not feeling great because then you can get injure .
” “ these day a lot of people be focus on aesthetic ; they want to be flexible , they want to look a certain way , but what we have get to remember be the whole point of yoga – originally , and i still agree with that – be mental .
so , while you be increase your mental focus , you also center yourself as well .
it be great for reduce stress level ; you connect with your mind and you kind of get into your body – you focus on your breathing , your movement .
all of this be great in term of center yourself and in term of your thought as well .
when you practice yoga , you get that increase focus , increase mind - body connection , and also spatial awareness in term of your body and coordination , which will also help you when it come to free weight .
“ i go to yoga that be quite physical rather than mindful .
i can only focus on what i be do – i guess that be the same in yoga .
you be focus on what you be do , rather than anything outside that could be come in .

therapeutic benefit of yoga as the popularity of mind - body fitness program , like yoga , continue to grow , it become increasingly important for healthcare professional to be knowledgeable about yoga and its many prove therapeutic benefit .
this article provide helpful information on the therapeutic effect of yoga in various population suffer from a multitude of different ailment and condition .
therapeutic yoga be define as the application of yoga posture and practice to the treatment of health condition .
yoga therapy involve instruction in yogic practice and teaching to prevent , reduce or alleviate structural , physiological , emotional and spiritual pain , suffering or limitation .
yoga be often seek out as a complementary therapy for mental health problem such as depression , anxiety , stress , and insomnia .
the relaxing and grounding nature of yoga can be helpful in shift the balance from the sympathetic nervous system ( cue the body to prepare for fight - or - flight response ) to the parasympathetic nervous system ( which be calm and restorative ) .
some of the way that this calm response manifest physically be low breathing and heart rate .
decrease blood pressure , low cortisol level , and increase blood flow to the intestine and vital organ .
yoga be main goal be to achieve tranquility of the mind , create a sense of well - be , and increase self - confidence while lower irritability .
the practice of yoga also optimize the body be sympathetic response to stressful stimulus .
reduces fear and aggression , and stimulate the pleasure center in the median forebrain .
yoga have be show to be an effective tool in the management of depression .
study have find that regular yoga practice lead to increase in serotonin level and decrease in the level of monamine oxidase and cortisol .
yoga be a safe and natural way to help improve mood and reduce stress and anxiety .
< END > < START > running be repetitive though your run may feature ever - change scenery , your body be do the same thing over and over again mechanically – put one foot in front of the other .
an average professional marathon runner , for instance , might take 25,000 step , while an average runner need 30,000 - 50,000 .
( the formula to figure it out be 1661220 inch in a marathon divide by your stride length . )
whatever it be , it be a lot .
the high number of repetition be relevant because they increase the likelihood of injury .
yoga for run injury prevention intuitively that make sense .
a car with 200,000 mile on it be more prone to breakdown compare to one with only 50,000. but what if you take care of the high mileage vehicle and drive the other car fast and furious all the time .
now which one be more likely to fail ?
i bring this up because there be a lot you can do to prevent run injury .
how often you run be only part of the reason you might get injure .
how you run and what else you do to support your run be more important , like add yoga .
run injury focus heavily on leg , include the knee , it band , shin , calf , hamstring , and foot .
know this , you can adopt a preventative strategy and prepare your body for run by do strength and mobility exercise .
if this be your goal , choose a type of yoga with these component .
( see best yoga for runner below ) think of yoga as a way to balance your body .
it strengthen area neglect by run , like your upper body , and provide variable movement to counteract running be repetition .
benefit of yoga for runner instead of repackaging the entire litany of yoga be benefit , which you can read about here , i find it more helpful to tailor the benefit of yoga for runner .
that be , what yoga benefit be go to impact your run most .
yoga teach runner to breath good yoga teach relaxation : the key to run effortlessly yoga teach how to be with discomfort yoga teach relaxation : the key to run effortlessly to our western mind , be relaxed mean we be on the couch scrolling through cat video .
in the east , relaxation be power .
the opposite of relaxation be tension , and it be a problem because it cost you metabolic energy .
you literally burn calorie to support the tension in your body through muscular contraction .
in yoga , we embrace the paradox that relaxation and tension coexist .
think of it as where you be spend your energy .
it be helpful to put energy in your leg , but not in your hand and face ?
yoga teach you how to be with the paradox because yoga practitioner learn to do difficult thing , like balance on one foot , or hold a warrior stance , while relax .
contrast this to a typical runner be approach , which be more about push .
it be easy to spot runner who first come to yoga because they generally try to force their way into yoga pose .
it be a strategy that can succeed in run at first – go hard , go fast .
and it will work a short time in yoga – before it injure you .
yoga a balance of tension and relaxation push and use force can benefit some yoga pose , like hold a plank or a lunge .
but it will work against you in most other posture .
to the casual observer , yoga look like you be do a series of posture .
the goal seem to be to get into as many yoga pose as you can .
but the yoga pose , or asana , be simply a tool we use .
they be the ball in soccer or the piece in chess .
it be how we use them that make it yoga .
take the notion of flexibility .
a familiar yoga pose be stand forward fold .
many people will try to grab their leg and pull themselves down as hard as they can .
that may strengthen your arm , but it predispose your back to injury and do not do much for your hamstring .
instead , balance the tension , which be engage your abdominal , quadriceps , and psoas to provide a stretch of your posterior chain , include your calf , hamstring , glute , and back .
intelligently use tension can create strength and flexibility simultaneously .
therefore , this be a more effective way to practice yoga .
yoga and body awareness for runner work in this way also make you more sensitive to what your body be do , what we call body awareness .
as a runner , i use body awareness to tell me when i have adequately warm up .
for instance , i may be physically sweating , and my heart rate monitor may tell me i be in the training zone .
however , if my outer knee feel a little off , i will extend the warm - up or even take it easy that day .
so again , yoga teach you another way to engage with tension .
this spawn such phrase as “ effortless effort ” and “ flow state .
” breathe well relax you , and it be one reason breath be so often bring up during yoga .
this be only one facet of relaxation , though .
another be how to relax when you be uncomfortable .
yoga teach how to be with discomfort discomfort be another area where the eastern and western mind diverge .
that be begin to change , especially in area around mental health and anxiety .
however , there be still the prevail view in society that we should try to avoid discomfort .
yoga take a different tack and actively embrace our uneasy feeling .
runner know there be go to be some uncomfortable moment along the way .
but , like their take on tension , many runner simply push through any unwanted sensation .
they suck it up and go on .
but there be another , more effective way .
yoga practitioner learn how to be comfortable with discomfort .
this be especially helpful for runner once you understand the concept behind it .
the concept of be with discomfort point 1 the feeling of discomfort be not go to go away .
point 2 but , you can get good at be with discomfort .
this first point recognize that discomfort be part of reality .
you be never go to banish it altogether .
in fact , it be part of life .
you eat breakfast , and you be hungry by lunch .
discomfort be something that be go to come up regularly .
so let be learn to be with it .
the second point say you can get more comfortable be uncomfortable .
and as you do , you can be with even more discomfort , which mean you can do amazing thing in life .
the default strategy in yoga be to befriend discomfort .
you get to know it like have a conversation with a confidant instead of ignore it and pretend it do not exist .
you deal with the reality of discomfort .
if this sound like mental gymnastics , it be .
you can think of yoga as train your mind .
yoga as mental training for run the difference that separate elite athlete from one another be primarily mental .
it be why the field of sport psychology exists .
the conversation you have with discomfort be really a conversation between you and your mind , which be why it be such a powerful skill .
many of our fear , worry , and doubt be remnant from long ago that just hang around .
often , they be no longer relevant .
concern be thing we have no control over but still expend enormous energy try to .
however , there be thing we can control .
for example , we can relax when intense feeling come up and breathe in a slow , full manner .
we can also discern between message of discomfort .
there be those root in the past and others that alert you to attend to something now .
in yoga , we learn this by watch our leg shake in a posture .
we take the stance of the observer and watch how the feeling move within us and generate pattern of thinking .
and we notice what intensify sensation and what allow them to pass .
be comfortable with discomfort give you a more proactive way to work with stress , be it physical , mental or emotional .
the benefit of yoga for runner all work together .
as you learn to breathe , it enhance your ability to relax .
you can then take the skill of relaxation to work with discomfort .
and all of these skill will make you a good runner .
power yoga power yoga give runner more postural option and be a variable sequence type .
variable sequence practice mean the posture change from class to class .
typically a power yoga teacher will build a flow and then take you through that flow repeatedly .
power yoga be characteristically heart - pounding and energetic .
if you be look for an alternative to run , this can be a good initial step .
however , power yoga be not great at building strength .
and the repetition of a sequence be often describe as feeling like you be “ go in circle .
” < END > < START > hat be proprioception ?
proprioception be a term you may have increasingly hear throw around by doctor and health professional when refer to ‘ body awareness — but what exactly do it mean and how do it affect you ?
it be often refer to as the body be sixth sense after sight , sound , smell , taste and touch .
in short , it be a sense which help inform your body where it be in space and the simple example of it in action be when you close your eye and touch your nose … after all , how do your finger know where your nose be ?
familiar example be when you play the piano ( without have to look at your hand on the key ) , throw a ball ( without have to look at your throw arm ) , and of course , practice yoga ( without have to constantly look at all of your limb ) .
our body be full of sensory receptor call proprioceptor , which be find mainly in our muscle , tendon and skin .
these sensory receptor receive stimulus from within our body that respond to position and movement .
season yogi have a highly developed sense of proprioception as it be a natural extension of be extremely aware of the body and its sensation .
practice yoga require proprioception as you move from pose to pose , maybe stand on one leg in warrior 3 and then open your hip to the side , before transition into half moon and lift your back leg up high .
you be effectively stay upright , whilst often balance on one leg , stretch out your muscle , and move your center of gravity around – without a sense of proprioception , you would certainly fall flat on your face !
example of proprioception in yoga have you ever practice a triangle pose and without thinking , by simply know where all your body part be in relation to one another , automatically pull your torso back in line with your hip , lengthen your spine , and stretch broadly across your chest ?
this , here , be proprioception in action , as you sense your way into the correct alignment without go off balance .
a simpler example be when you step back from the front of your mat into a high lunge without look down at your foot .
your body instinctively know its location , movement and action , which mean you can confidently step back freely without fall over .
a different example be when you pick up a yoga block : you know roughly how much it weigh , thus the proprioceptor in your muscle will automatically know how much strength to use in order to lift it , and you do this without a second thought .
every yoga pose will challenge your sense of proprioception to some degree .
even in the pose which you find be more natural and easy to do , you can still experiment far by practice in a new environment , on a different surface ( grass , sand , thick carpet ) , or simply by close your eye .
how to improve your sense of proprioception if you be new to yoga , you can start with a simple balance pose such as tree pose , use prop or a nearby wall to help you stay steady .
if you be already comfortable with this , challenge yourself by look up towards the ceiling , close your eye , or rotate your torso side to - side .
if you be more experienced with yoga , play around with arm balance such as crow pose or grasshopper pose , where you need to have particularly good control over both your strength and balance .
if arm balance be not for you , find a new yoga pose that you have not do before , which will test your muscle and what they already know .
alternatively , practice yoga in a new space that you be not familiar with , or on a contrast surface to what you be normally use to , which will force your body to adjust .
finally , maintain your proprioception and sense of balance as you age be essential .
if you be not convince , accord to public health england statistic , people age 65 and over have the high risk of fall , which can lead to serious injury or bad .
the numerous balancing pose in yoga provide the perfect challenge for develop your proprioceptive receptor , which will help to keep you healthy and stable as you grow old .
< END > < START > lighten load if you have spend any significant time work to push your performance to the next level , you know that an occasional tweak will happen that create some soreness with exercise .
usually , these tweak though be nothing to worry about , and training can continue as normal .
but what can you do when a more significant injury occurs ?
after month or year of hard work to improve your performance , you ca not just stop training during this injury .
you need to continue train when injure to not only maintain your fitness ( strength , hypertrophy , endurance , etc . )
but to continue improve in whatever way possible .
fortunately , some minor change in your training plan can keep you train without exacerbate tissue heal timeline .
use these tactic as idea to implement to continue train when injure ( not medical advice ) .
five tactic to continue train when injured limit range of motion for many muscle and tendon injury , pain and more damage can happen when the muscle be under tension in a stretched position .
so in these condition , limit the range of motion can be a great way to continue train hard and heavy without slow tissue healing .
for example , in an athlete that have strain his or her pec muscle limit the range of motion with an exercise such as a floor press instead of a bench press can often be enough to allow an athlete to push heavy weight without pain .
deadlifts can be another example of this .
many athlete recover from low back pain have difficulty pull a barbell from the ground .
but deadlifts be a great exercise to use when rehabbing from back pain .
by elevate the bar a few inch off the ground can be a great tactic to continue pull weight , building strength , and work the hip hinge pattern .
use exercise variation small change in the exercise variation we perform can be another great strategy for continued training when injure .
alter your grip , torso angle , knee positioning , etc .
can change the amount of load place on an injured joint or muscle .
let be use the squat as an example .
the front squat typically have a more upright torso versus the back squat .
for many athlete with hip or back pain , this slight change in set up can allow for pain - free training .
for athlete with shoulder pain , subtle change such as change your grip angle can have a positive impact .
switch to a neutral grip with a football bar or dumbbells rather than a barbell with exercise like the bench press or overhead press can very quickly change the pain you feel .
unloaded irritated tissue sometimes we need to unload a tissue to avoid overstrain it completely .
but we can use exercise variation to continue train the surround muscle to continue to improve their strength .
for example , in someone with low back pain not tolerate compressive loading very well or a post - op shoulder , barbell squat variation may not be possible .
the belt squat be one great option to continue load the leg without risk these heal tissue in other area .
a banded hip hinge movement be another excellent example of how we can unload the spine while still push leg loading .
place a resistance band around the hip to resist hip extension .
as the individual become more tolerant of spinal loading , they can add external resistance with barbell or dumbbell to challenge the hip and spine while decrease the band resistance .
i know that we all want to train hard and heavy .
but at time , we ca not push maximal load .
if we have to lift light weight , we simply push up the volume to similar to what we would program in a hypertrophy block .
as the injured tissue heal and tolerate heavier loading , we decrease the volume and increase the weight .
here be an example of how we might progress that over several week : 1st week : 3×25 2nd week : 3×20 3rd week : 3×15 4th week : 5×10 5th week : 5×8 6th week : 5×5 train contralateral in extreme situation , an area may not be able to be load at all .
the best example of this would be after an orthopedic surgery , we frequently have suture hold tissue together .
if overload , the repaired tissue will fail , so we have minimal option for train that area .
in this case , we be go to push train the uninjured side as muscle as possible because research have show that this help us maintain strength and muscle mass on the injured extremity .
while many fear that do this will create a deficit in side to side strength or muscle mass , the opposite appear correct , we will decrease the amount of fitness we lose .
once the healing process progress , we can begin use some of the above strategy to begin rebuild fitness .
< END > < START > unfortunately , thing can happen in life or sport that result in an injury .
injury be a frustrating time for obvious reason , but if you think that an injury mean you must stop training , think again !
if for example you have a fracture in your left arm , you can certainly continue to exercise in the gym .
you can strength train your low body and undertake cycling ( or other form of cardiovascular exercise ) .
another important rehabilitation strategy when you have one side injure be to complete unilateral ( one side ) weight train on your opposite ( uninjured ) side .
people often neglect train the uninjured side which be have show to increase recovery !
but will not train only one side result in significant muscular imbalance ?
accord to numerous study , no .
in fact , research have show that correctly tailor exercise have not only be show to strengthen the uninvolved side but maintain strength and sometimes even muscle mass in the injured limb !
resistance training be a powerful stimulus for neuromuscular adaptation .
( 1 ) these adaptation be not limit to the work muscle and have in fact be show to result in increase in strength and neural drive in a contralateral , rest muscle .
( 1 ) the phenomenon result in this sparing of strength and size on an uninvolved limb be term ‘ cross - education .
( 1 , 2 ) this have be demonstrate in numerous study : they conduct a study on 16 participant whereby the nondominant forearm be immobilize in a cast , while participant be either assign to an exercise group ( eccentric wrist flexion , 3x / week ) or a control group ( no exercise ) for 4 week .
( 2 ) the study find that the resistance training group maintain not only strength , but also muscle cross sectional area of the wrist flexor in the immobilized limb .
( 2 ) furthermore , and colleague conduct a similar study , this time test the effect of exercise on quadriceps strength and muscle activation in an uninvolved limb .
( 3 ) the exercise group exercise their uninjured limb 3x / week for 8 week and the study again conclude that great strength and activation occur in the unexercised limb in the exercise group when compare to the control group .
similarly , a study conduct test the effect of unilateral training to either the left or right leg in 20 previously untrained individual .
( 4 ) the study be conduct over 10 week ( 34 session ) of single - leg exercise complete both the leg press and leg extension .
( 4 ) similarly , this study also conclude that the 10 - week program result in a significant increase in both maximal strength and muscle size in the untrained leg , again demonstrate a cross - education effect .
( 4 ) hence , the research demonstrate the benefit that train an uninjured limb can have on the injured limb .
when you be injure , it be important that you continue with a structured strength train program as your recovery outcome be well .
injury can be a frustrating and demotivating time , especially if you let them keep you away from training .
a tailored exercise routine during a time of injury can still benefit you !
at inspire fitness for well be we adopt this with many of our member in order to keep them on track to achieve their goal .
we do this through our design of individually tailor exercise program that can be shape around a potential injury , in order to keep you active and improve your overall health and well-being .
< END > < START > “ i have injure my “ insert body part ” what can i do ?
” this be the question most people face when injure , and let be firstly state the answer be not just rest !
we have previously discuss the benefit of begin rehabilitation asap on the injured site ( see blog here ) , but what if i tell you that train your uninjured side can result in strength gain on your injured side ?
researcher from the university of copenhagen study the effect of disuse on muscle strength , and reveal in their young subject that two week inactivity result in a staggering 33 percent loss in leg strength , leave them on par with a person who be 40 - 50 year their senior !
and if this be not shock enough , it can take 2 - 3 time as long to regain this lost strength !
fortunately , we have something call the cross - education effect that we can take advantage of !
the cross - education effect be a phenomenon whereby train one side of the body result in an increased strength of the opposite side of the body .
this effect be first observe and publish in the literature over 100 year ago , and since this time there have be hundred of study examine this topic .
what sort of gain can we experience from this cross - education effect ?
the size of contralateral strength gain varies base on the length and type of training , but a 2018 meta - analysis by reveal a strength gain of : 18 percent in young , able - body adult 15 percent in old , able - bodied participant , 29 percent in a patient population consist of post stroke , neuromuscular disorder , and osteoarthritis patient .
this be quite staggering consider this represent 52 - 80 percent of the gain in the trained limb , and it be not even be use !
these effect do not seem to be limit to a single muscle group or area ; benefit have be see all over the body .
how do it happen , and how can we maximize it ?
as yet , researcher have not reach a consensus on the exact mechanism of effect , but the leading theory be that the strength gain on the untrained side be neurally drive .
it be theorize that the cross - over effect be perhaps the body be attempt to strive for symmetry a study examine train parameter ( set / rep / contraction type ) that might maximize the cross - education effect .
they find that perform 3 - 5 set of 8 - 15 repetition of eccentric contraction with rest time of 1 - 2 minute between set , create the great change .
they also find that high - load and more cognitively demand strength training , such as use a metronome to control movement , increase cross - education .
potential us of the cross - education effect any injury that result in an inability to perform your usual resistance training .
some example of its use could include : shoulder pain , and only able to perform 50 percent of your usual bench press and overhead press ?
switch to dumbbell , continue train the uninjured side at 100 percent , and do what you can perform on the injured side break leg and in a cast for 6 week ?
switch to single - leg weight for the uninjured side i.e .
leg press , leg extension , leg curl , split squat , calf raise , to slow the decline in strength of the injured leg .
acute flare - up of knee osteoarthritis ?
train the other leg to take advantage of a 29 percent gain !
shoulder or acl reconstruction ?
early in the rehab process whilst not able to do much on the operated side , keep train the opposite side !
conclusion an injury be not an excuse to stop training do not neglect the uninjured side , use unilateral training to take advantage of the cross - education effect .
cross - education can result in a staggering 18 - 29 percent gain in strength of the opposite side 3 - 5 set of 8 - 15 rep of eccentric contraction with rest time of 1 - 2 minute between set , and also use a metronome when performing may result in a great change .
< END > < START > if you have ever deal with an injury before run in a race or another sporting event , you have probably wonder whether it be safe to continue exercise and training .
although stay less active during recovery can be difficult , exercise while injure can hinder your healing .
here be what you need to know about exercise while deal with a sport injury .
what be a sport injury ?
“ sport injury happen as a result of exercise or other physical activity , . ``

if your healthcare provider recommend rest , take this seriously .
rest when your body tell you it need to .
some injury may be support by use a wrap , brace , or splint .
it be important that any supportive device you wear fit properly .
ask your doctor , physical therapist , or trainer for recommendation .
as you return to exercise , you may need to dial back the intensity or frequency of your regular routine to give your body enough time to recover between session .

give yourself regular rest and recovery days.4 maintain flexibility and balance : tight muscle cause imbalance that can lead to injury .
for example , if your quadriceps ( front of the leg ) be strong than your hamstring ( back of the leg ) , you be at risk for strain or even rupture your hamstring .
strengthen your whole body : make sure you incorporate regular weight train into your weekly routine .
strengthen all muscle group reduces imbalance that case other muscle to overcompensate .
< END > < START > while the physical aspect of take time off can be tough , the emotional aspect of feeling sideline be the big challenge .
`` most medium coverage highlight the physical benefit of exercise frequently , but we also experience an enormous emotional benefit .
`` the mental health benefit of exercise include less stress , high confidence , and even good creativity .
and while it take two to four week to lose strength and conditioning , the mental impact of remove exercise from your routine happen almost immediately .
that say , have a plan for when you need to take some time off can make your life a lot easy .
here be what rehab pro recommend do to care for both your mental and physical health when you be deal with an injury .
how to train if you be injure if you be sideline for a day or two ... the mental : use your time off wisely .
miss a workout or two be a bummer , but it be important to remind yourself it be not the end of the world .
one of the best tool you can use , she say , be positive self - talk .
tell yourself something like , `` it be temporary , i can deal with it `` or `` i be still strong `` can go a long way toward put thing in perspective .
aside from that , try use the time productively to plan your next training session , reach out to others who you know have deal with similar injury to get their advice , or connect with a physical therapist or trainer to learn about how to prevent the injury you be currently deal with .
to replace the mental release you get from your workout , try use relaxation method like meditation and progressive muscle relaxation , suggest mark .
the physical : treat it as recovery time .
luckily , take a day or two off from exercise be no big deal , even if it be unplanned .
`` i think it be important to think of a few day off as crucial to rehab a minor injury — not only to prevent a more significant injury that would result in even more missed time — but also as the recovery that be important for performance , `` say lou .
`` a lot of athlete think about training as make gain and rest as missed gain , but it be not completely true .
the body need rest and recovery in order to maximize the benefit from training and work out .
`` simply think of this time as some extra rest and recovery so you can crush your next workout when you be feel well .
if you be sideline for a week or two ... the mental : see it as an opportunity to cross - train .
take a week or two off from your workout of choice be not ideal .
`` it can be really tough mentally for athlete and people who love to work out to be sideline for a chunk of time , `` say lou .
but there be a simple way to make yourself feel productive : `` this be a great time to cross - train or to make time to train a specific strength or skill that will help with overall performance goal but get forgotten during period of training .
`` for example : if you be a weightlifter and you have injure your wrist , maybe now be a good time to do some cardio workout you would not normally have time for .
or if you be a runner with a sprained ankle , you could work on upper body strength and core strength in the weight room .
whatever you decide to do , it be critical to set specific and achievable goal to stay focused and motivate , say lou .
the physical : fix the problem .
if you be force to take time off for more than a few day for a non - acute injury , it usually mean your body be try to tell you something .
`` in my opinion , it be most important to understand that you ca not build strength on an injury and without proper healing time . ``
`` most importantly , you should never ignore pain , `` she say .
`` pain be the way your body communicate that you be at risk for an injury .
`` provide you do not have a traumatic injury , like a broken bone or wound , pain that be prevent you from work out usually mean your body have be compensate for weakness `` `` you should not just focus on the pain , but rather on address the cause of the pain .
`` some smart way to do this include self - myofascial release through foam rolling , use a lacrosse or tennis ball on tender area , and do gentle exercise that avoid the injured area .
if you be not sure what to do , it be a good idea to check in with a physical therapist .
if you be sideline for a month or two ( or long ) ... the mental : stay positive , ask for support , and take action .
`` significant time off can be psychologically and emotionally distressing , `` say mark .
four crucial thing to keep in mind : mental health be equally important to physical recovery .
social support be key .
you ca not get back to full fitness on your will alone , but a positive outlook have be show to significantly aid recovery .
you can do something every day to work toward rehabilitation .
`` take action , even simply by do pt exercise or cook a healthy meal , can reduce feeling of powerlessness and low self - esteem while simultaneously contribute to physical recovery , `` she add .
( expert also recommend incorporate anti - inflammatory food into your healthy meal when you be heal from an injury .
the physical : ask for an alternative .
if you be go to be out of commission for a significant chunk of time , a good physical therapist will provide you with alternative and substitution to your usual workout .
unless you have an injury that affect your whole body , there be almost always something else you can do to stay active .
`` walking , swimming , and yoga be great general choice but nearly any workout can be modify around pain with the right strategy , `` he add .
with the help of a professional , you can work toward maintain strength and conditioning , so that you be ready to get back into action when the time come .
( you should also work on your mobility to prevent future injury . )
< END > < START > yoga and stretch for injury prevention and rehabilitation strength , active flexibility , balance , and coordination for reduce injury soft tissue ( joint , muscle , connective tissue ) injury happen when the outside force exceed the force your body can generate in return .
strength the strong your muscle be , the more stable your joint become , directly reduce the likelihood of injury .
strong muscle can withstand more physical stress and protect your joint by absorb the impact that might otherwise strain them .
active flexibility the way active flexibility play a crucial role in reduce the risk of injury be quite similar to strength .
active flexibility mean you have the necessary strength and control of your joint be range of motion .
unlike passive flexibility , where an external force be use to achieve a stretch , active flexibility require your muscular effort .
which in turn help protect the joint against outside force .
active flexibility also enhance your body be proprioceptive ability , which be know where your body part be in space .
as a result , your movement become more controlled and less likely to go beyond safe limit , thereby prevent strain , sprain , and other injury .
balance balance be all about maintain your body be move or stationary position .
have a good balance mean your body can redistribute your weight accord to your movement , which help you avoid fall and stumble that could lead to injury .
a balanced and strong body be also adept at react to change in terrain or direction , which be crucial for avoid misstep that could lead to sprained ankle or similar injury .
coordination coordination be the ability of your body part to work in unison to execute a movement smoothly .
similarly to balance , coordination help you avoid misstep that might put your joint in position where they ca not react quickly enough to counteract the outside force .
yoga and stretching can help us reduce injury and aid recovery .
but the benefit that each practice delivers be different .
how yoga can reduce the risk of injury and aid the rehab although yoga be main aim be to help the practitioner attain harmony and good understand themselves , the physical aspect can also help with injury reduction and recovery .
regularly practice yoga can improve your strength , balance , and coordination .
but yoga alone be not enough to build the strength need to significantly reduce the risk of injury .
for that purpose , strength training and active stretching be more effective .
nevertheless , like any movement , yoga can help restore the range of motion after an injury .
perhaps the great benefit yoga can offer for reduce and rehabbing injury be how it help reduce stress and anxiety .
we know that high level of unmanaged stress and anxiety can reduce pain tolerance and slow recovery after an injury .
low level of stress and anxiety also help you sleep good , allow the body to recover .
both when recover when injured , but also to simply recover between workout .
how stretching can reduce the risk of injury and aid the rehab active stretching be your best bet for reduce the risk of injury .
unlike passive stretching , active stretching help to strengthen your muscle .
and the strong your muscle , the less susceptible they be to injury .
and if you do get injure , the strength you have build with active stretching and strength training will likely reduce the severity of the injury .
moreover , stretch , like yoga , can help restore the range of motion after an injury , make it an integral part of your rehabilitation process .
but again , active stretching take the cake over passive stretching and yoga for restore the range of motion .
< END > < START > which muscle injury can you stretch ?
the first thing to understand be which muscle injury be ok for stretch and which be not .
two of the most common muscle injury for young athlete be : muscle strain : stretching or tearing of muscle fiber muscle contusion ( also call a muscle bruise ) : injury to muscle fiber , connective tissue or blood vessel usually from a direct blow stretching can help you heal from a muscle strain , as long as it be not severe .
stretch can also help when heal a new muscle contusion .
for example , our athletic trainer often recommend simultaneously ice and stretch quad contusion right after the injury .
what be a muscle strain ?
also know as a pulled or torn muscle , a muscle strain be when the muscle fiber pull apart from each other and be damage .
this can come from put too much weight on the muscle , overuse or fatigue , an accident or use the muscle incorrectly .
the right stretch at the right time be a key component in that treatment plan .
stretch be not only important to prevent further injury and scar tissue , but also help a newly injure muscle lengthen to release the body be natural response to spasm .
young athlete can often pull a muscle by do exercise incorrectly or during their sport .
the do of stretch a newly injure muscle the most important thing to pay attention to be the kind of pain you be feel .
“ a good indicator when it be ok to begin gentle stretching be when the pain in the injured area have shift from sharp or stab to more of a soreness or stiffness , ” say .
“ you should not start until that happen .
” when stretch a newly injure muscle , it will help if you : do wait three day to a week after the injury , depend on severity and symptom , to begin stretch .
use pain as a guide ; if you feel sharp pain in the injured area , it mean it be too early to start stretching .
do wait until the inflammation mostly go away before the first stretch .
do start with gentle static stretch – reach and hold rather than do movement - base stretching .
do ensure the stretching be mostly pain - free to help the healing process .
do incorporate a consistent dynamic warm - up routine and include static stretching after an activity to prevent soreness and improve flexibility .
timing be everything when it come to what you should not do when stretch an injured muscle .
if your muscle be not relax , it can affect the muscle around it .
“ stretch before the muscle can relax be set yourself up for further injury ” .
when stretch a newly strain muscle : do not necessarily use the rest , ice , compress and elevate ( rice ) method right away to begin heal a strained muscle .
he explain that use ice later to alleviate some spasm can help but slap on ice right after an injury can actually increase healing time .
compression and rest can be helpful in a newly strain muscle depend on the severity of the injury .
do not push your stretch “ just a little bit far ” than comfortable .
this can delay the healing process .
do not wait too long to begin stretch .
for a minor strain that may be just a few day .
for a moderate strain that could be 1 to 2 week and for a severe strain that could extend to 2 to 6 week .
wait too long can create scar tissue , reduce flexibility and strength .
do not immediately return to understand what your body need most , regardless of severity , be the most important aspect of stretch and heal an injured muscle .
you should be pain free , back to full strength and flexibility and have complete a slow ramp - up of activity to ensure the area do not feel aggravate .
< END > < START > if you have a sport injury , chance be you will need to take some time off to rest , recover , and regroup .
but if you do not want to stop all exercise , there be way to maintain base fitness while recover from many sport injury .

detrain or deconditioning be a fact of life when you stop exercise , but if you simply want to maintain a base of fitness , there be a few way to stay active .
you can maintain your fitness level even if you need to change or cut back on your exercise for several month .
in order to do so , you need to exercise at about 70 percent of your vo2 max at least once per week .
before you do any exercise after an injury , it be wise to get the approval and recommendation of your treat physician or therapist .
follow their recommendation about when you can resume exercise , how much , and what type of exercise be best.1﻿ return to exercise after an injury even if one body part or joint be immobilize , there be usually no reason that you ca not find other way to stay fit while rehabilitate by use the principle of cross - training .
it may take some creativity and the flexibility to try new thing , but most athlete find train through injury be possible and not terribly difficult .
the key be to maintain the right attitude and remain active within your tolerance until your injury be heal .
here be some way to continue work out while recover from four common injury .
ankle and foot injury if your ankle or foot be injure , you still have many exercise option .
if your doctor approve it and you be able to , try use the rowing machine , a stationary bike with one leg , or swimming .
work with your doctor or trainer to find other non - weight bearing cardio exercise you can do and spend 30 to 60 minute about three time a week on that exercise to maintain endurance .
leg and knee injury leg and knee injury can be fairly limit for most athlete .
almost all endurance exercise require flexion and extension of the knee joint , so develop a new routine may be frustrate .
one - legged cycling , kayaking , or use an upper - body ergometer ( hand cycle ) be option .
swimming may be possible if you use a pull buoy so you do not kick or use your leg .
elbow and shoulder injury shoulder or other upper body injury often allow the most possibility for continue traditional cardio exercise because the low body can be exercise fully .
walking , stair climbing , stationary ( hand - free ) cycling , and the elliptical trainer be all possibility .
< END > < START > the pain and trauma of get hurt be bad enough .
then you have to recover , which likely mean that you be take time off from your standard routine of physical training , curtail whatever goal you be strive to achieve .
but just because you be hurt , that do not mean you need to shut down your training completely until your injury fully heals .
you just have to understand how to work smart around your limitation .
if approach properly — and with your doctor be approval , importantly — there be still way to move forward with your training plan while you be recover from an injury .
ground rule for work out with an injury before you go all in , just remember two ground rule : listen to your doctor whether you be recover from surgery or other type of traumatic injury , the body need to heal .
your physician be the best source for get you back to 100 percent .
remember your limit take a little off the top when it come to volume and load .
you be still in the healing process .
now be the time to make some adjustment while still be able to train hard .
once you check those box , it be time adjust your training plan by incorporate these three rule for wise and effective training through an injury .
you will still make gain , even while you be in a little bit of pain .
“ you will convert that injury into an opportunity , ” say .
“ we be not only go to build muscle right now , but we be go to set ourselves up for great gain in the future .
” 3 rule for train while injured focus on isolation exercise normally compound move be the way to go when muscle building be your goal , but if you have one limb out of commission , it be ideal to reduce the tension in that area as much as possible .
the best way to do this be with isolation exercise .
for example , if heavy deadlifts and squat be no longer an option , attack your low body with move such as leg extension and calf raise .
train the healthy part of your body if you be worried about look like an unbalanced weirdo after train only one side of your body , relax .
you be not go to end up with a mismatched arm or leg size if you shift your focus to one side of your body — that be a fitness myth .
actually research say the opposite : training your healthy side while your other side be recover can actually help you avoid lose muscle on the injured limb .
so , use unilateral training , it be ok — even encourage — to attack that side heavy no matter the exercise , from press to row .
load up and go .
< END > < START > differentiate soreness from pain soreness be almost to be expect during rigorous activity , especially if you have not exercise in a while or you have recently increase the intensity of your workout .
this sore or achy feeling be a result of micro - tear or mild inflammation in your muscle or tendon , which be normal .
the muscle repair the tear while you be rest , and it help the muscle to grow in size and strength .
you may even feel like your soreness do not appear until hour or day after the activity .
say this phenomenon be call delayed onset muscle soreness ( doms ) and it usually start 24 hour follow the activity , resolve in , at the most , seven day .
it be alright to exercise if you be experience soreness , and physical activity might actually help alleviate the ache .
but say any soreness lasting long than a week be not normal and should be follow up on with your primary care physician .
“ if you begin to experience chest pain or shortness of breath while work out , this be a sign to stop what you be do and call your doctor as well , ” she add .
“ another thing to look out for be extreme soreness , tight / hard muscle , numbness , tingle and dark - colored urine .
these symptom can be due to muscle breakdown and a rare condition call rhabdomyolysis which warrant a trip to the emergency room !
” while experience sore muscle be normal , pain be not .
pain represent injury ; it be our body be way of let us know something be not right .
pain during or after exercise can be a sign of overuse or too much stress place on a muscle or tendon .
when it be a result of repetitive use or a single episode of overload a muscle or tendon , it be refer to as a muscle strain .
“ push through sharp , acute pain could be cause more damage than good take away the initial benefit of exercise , ” explains .
“ if your soreness turn into pain or push you past your comfort level , it be time to scale back .
also , if pain start to dictate how you perform the exercise or if it cause you to modify the activity to compensate for the pain , you be definitely do too much !
” sign of overtraining include : fatigue depression sleep disturbances an increase in sickness unresolved muscle soreness if you be suffer from any of these symptom , it be time to speak with your doctor about set a healthy workout schedule and nutrition plan .
take a break if you be experience pain , the best thing to do be to rest and give your muscle or tendon the time they need to recover .
suggests use ice for acute swelling or injury , and you can apply heat to the affected area for up to 72 hour follow an injury .
she also suggest light stretch and range of motion exercise , as well as foam rolling , yoga and massage to help stimulate the muscle and increase blood flow .
if need , you can also use topicals , anti - inflammatories or a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( ten ) unit to treat mild soreness or pain .
if the pain do not resolve after two week of rest , ice and activity modification , recommend reach out to your doctor .
if you be experience acute pain , especially accompany by swell , it be well to reach out sooner rather than later .
prevention the best way to prevent injury and pain be to ease into your workout .
perform dynamic stretch versus static stretching have be show to reduce muscle tightness well .
dynamic stretching be movement - base instead of hold a pose in traditional stretching .
for instance , instead of hold a traditional lunge , try a walking lunge with a twist .
get into a traditional lunge then twist your torso toward the front thigh .
stand back up and walk out into a lunge on the other side and repeat , twist your torso toward that leg .
traditional stretching and foam rolling can be add at the end of a workout when your muscle be already warm .
if at any point you experience pain , back down .
it be well to stop or modify an exercise than to further any injury .
“ when start a new exercise routine , take it slow , ” say .
“ do not expect change overnight .
small step in the right direction will get you to your goal safely and hopefully injury - free !
” < END > < START > ditch the hiit and ease back into an exercise routine with these low - impact workout idea .
as someone who spend most of their time work with fitness equipment and do fitness challenge for youtube video , i have suffer my fair share of injury and have have to learn a thing or two about modify exercise so that i can get back into a routine after get hurt .
i have a hunch that if you be hit the gym day - in - and - day - out , you may one day be in a situation where you need to modify your workout to get back in the saddle too .
get back into exercise after any time off , whether it be due to an injury or not , should be a thoughtful and intentional process .
the best low - impact exercise , like swimming , yoga and light resistance training be a great place to start .
and keep in mind , these be not your grandma be exercise .
well , they might be , but what i mean be , just because they do not involve jumping or slam weight do not mean they have no effect .
they point out that engage in these activity can help you gradually ( and smartly ! )
rebuild your strength so you can get back to do what you love .
what be low - impact exercise ?
low - impact exercise training include any kind of exercise that put minimal stress on the joint .
the goal with low - impact workout be to keep the body move well without put it through unwanted or unnecessary strain .
“ low impact exercise be a great way to take care of your body , especially after an injury , because we rarely ever want to stop move completely , ” she say .
“ the goal be to keep move without exacerbate pain or tissue damage .
” walking , swimming , bike riding , yoga , stretch and light strength training be great example of activity you can do without overwork your body .
conversely , you will be ditch movement such as jumping , run , burpees , and maxing out your deadlift .
who be low - impact exercise good for ?
anyone can benefit from low - impact training , but it be particularly helpful for those who be rehabilitate an injury , be just return to exercise , or be prone to joint or back pain .
perform low - impact exercise be critical during the early recovery period after an injury .
“ engage in gentle exercise keep your body as strong as possible while avoid pain or reinjury , ” she say .
“ it be important to keep your body move while you recover , so you can ease back into fitness , instead of become deconditioned and then try to jump back into an intense workout routine .
” doctor long , a licensed physical therapist add , “ one of the big mistake i see athlete make when they be injure be go into full rest mode .
when we elevate our heart rate , our body release chemical that have pain relieving effect and pump our heart rate up help remove inflammation around damage tissue .
so even when tissue be significantly hurt , find way to exercise be a critical component to rehab .
” in addition to those who be recover from an injury , people who tend to overdo high - intensity exercise can seriously benefit from a few low - impact workout day each week .
high - volume workout have their place , but too much of a good thing can be a bad thing : study have show that too much high - intensity exercise can lead to muscle damage , inflammation , delay onset muscle soreness ( doms ) , and fatigue .
intentionally sprinkle in low - impact and low - intensity workout each week help prevent overtraining , which have negative physical and psychological effect .
if you continue to train without give your body ample time to recover , you may compromise strength and performance , leave yourself at an increase risk of hurt yourself — and then you will be do low - impact exercise because you have to , not because you choose to .
how to add low - impact exercise to your workout routine depend on your specific scenario , you can choose to follow a program that be exclusively low - impact , or you can work some gentle exercise into your weekly routine as a complement to high - intensity training .
it be vital to have a well balance program that also include cardiovascular training , mobility exercise , and strengthening of small muscle that support good posture and exercise technique .
to achieve a balanced routine like that , we recommend use a variety of equipment , include resistance band , light dumbbell and kettlebells , and a yoga mat for floor - base exercise .
you will also want to invest in some good walking shoe and , if you have access to a swimming pool , a swimsuit you can wear for water exercise .
how you structure your weekly workout be up to you and your team of fitness or medical professional .
generally , get at least 30 minute of low - impact exercise each day be recommend , whether that look like a 30 - minute walk or 20 minute of strength training follow by 10 minute of stretch .
you may want to experiment with different workout schedule to find the combination that work best for you .
a good rehab program design by your physical therapist may include gradually add in low impact cardio in addition to rehab exercise to help regain strength and endurance .
mix low - impact exercise into your regular exercise routine can increase overall muscle recovery and help rejuvenate your body between session so you can perform your best .
one of the most important point we can make : take it slow .
“ if you have be inactive for a while due to an injury , you may be pretty deconditioned , and find that your muscle fatigue faster during a workout . ``
“ if you try to push it too hard at the gym without build back muscle mass and strength , you put yourself at risk of reinjuring yourself .
or you may suffer from extreme muscle soreness , make the day after your workout pretty unpleasant .
” low - impact exercise be a great way to get all the benefit of physical activity without increase your risk of a setback .
best low - impact exercise for rehabbing an injury when recover from injury , there be many low impact exercise that can help you regain your strength and mobility , decrease recovery time .
most low impact exercise can be do at home with the right cardio machine and strength training equipment .
best low - impact cardio workouts swim swimming be the perfect low impact exercise as it take gravity out of the equation , put less stress on your joint .
expert often recommend swim lap for those recover from an injury or joint replacement or for those with inflammation or arthritis , as exercise in the water help prevent joint pain .
( it can also be a fun change compare to typical cardio workout on land — i will not judge if you join your local water aerobics class . )
bike biking , whether it be on an exercise bike or outdoor training , be low impact as the bike offer support and stability , take pressure off the joint of the hip , knee and ankle .
biking be primarily a cardiovascular exercise — it will definitely get your heart rate up — but it can also help you build muscle , increase overall mobility and increase joint range of motion , which be important for those recover from an injury .
if you need extra support for your joint , doctor suggest try a recumbent stationary bike until your joint be healthy and strong enough to support you on a regular bike .
row if you really want to get your heart pump sans impact , try row for low - impact cardio exercise .
unless you live close to a lake , stationary rowing machine be the go to piece of equipment when it come to a row workout .
row work all muscle of the body , be easy on the joint , and can be do at vary intensity .
like biking , it can increase cardiovascular fitness and mobility and be a great way to move the body gently but effectively .
row also amps up the calorie burn and can help with weight loss .
elliptical ellipticals be design to provide a low impact , full - body workout , without put extra strain on the joint and ligament .
ellipticals provide good cardio workout for beginner , old adult , those recover from injury , or for those who be unable to run due to physical limitation .
ellipticals provide a similar workout to cycling , except you remain in a standing position , which help activate your core and upper body .
they not only help increase endurance after an injury but can be a good way to flush out the muscle if you be feel sore after a workout .
best low - impact strength training exercise resistance band train tube resistance band offer vary level of tension and can be use for many different body part .
resistance band exercise be a great low intensity option as it be easy to target small muscle such as those in the shoulder or hip and can be use for rehab exercise as well as accessory work .
this will help you regain strength in area that be weak post - injury and prepare you for hard workout in the future .
yoga we have all heard that we should do yoga for the mindfulness aspect , but if you be use to heavy strength train this can be a drastic change of pace with awesome benefit for your health and wellness .
yoga move your body through a series of posture and isometric position and be a great way to stretch out tight muscle , improve posture and focus on breathe so you can perform good in all area of life .
( and do not get it twisted : yoga be hard .
i always underestimate the challenge that be a yoga flow . )
light dumbbell exercise you do not always have to lift heavy when do dumbbell exercise .
by move slowly and use a light weight than you normally would , dumbbell work can be a great low - intensity exercise to do after an injury .
light dumbbell can be use to rehab the muscle of the shoulder , back , arm , leg , and glute .
these exercise be a great opportunity to focus on form as you recover from injury so you can continue to move correctly as you start to lift heavy weight .
squat , lunge , and dumbbell deadlifts be great low - impact exercise for the low body ; dumbbell bench press , overhead press , and bicep curl be good choice for your upper body .
bodyweight strength training believe it or not , you do not need dumbbell or any other equipment for an effective resistance training workout .
bodyweight strength training be one of the best low - impact activity — if you choose the right exercise .
avoid jumping jack and burpees and stick to thing like squat and modify push - ups to reap the benefit of low - impact exercise .
also , practice and perfect proper form with just your body weight help to reduce your risk of injury when you do decide to add external weight .
dynamic stretch dynamic stretch be a fun way to warm up , but you can also do them in isolation to help stretch the muscle and increase range of motion .
unlike static stretch ( where you stay in one position ) you be constantly move through various movement to loosen up the muscle and ligament .
they can be use for injury prevention but be also helpful for post - injury rehab .
no matter your fitness level , stretch be a key part of a well - round workout routine .
core strengthening exercise if you be lack core strength due to inactivity , it be key to rebuild your core strength before jump into a high intensity strength program , doctor say .
“ core strengthening be especially important after a back injury and will help prevent future injury when do properly .
” some example of low - impact core exercise include : bird dog , dead bug , russian twist , and lie flutter kick .
coop be take low - impact exercise be a great way to stimulate your muscle when recover from an injury or a really intense strength training session .
not only do they keep you active without add unnecessary stress to your body , but a low - impact workout be a great opportunity to focus on area of your body that may not be get enough attention in your normal workout routine .
this not only help boost performance but add some variety to your week to keep thing interest , prevent burnout .
although high intensity exercise be often see as more fun , do not discredit the benefit of low intensity exercise , especially if you be come off an injury or have take some time away from the gym .
bottom line if you be active , it be not uncommon to sustain an injury at some point in your life .
this should not deter you from ever work out again , but it may change how your workout look for a while .
just because you be hurt do not mean that you should not exercise , but you may have to incorporate more low - intensity exercise for a while until you can build back your strength and endurance .
even if you be not injure , ditch your usual high - impact workout for some gentler aerobic exercise a few time per week have amazing health benefit .
< END > < START > here be 10 modification that you can use to prevent further injury while maintain strength in other area .
you might also want to refresh your memory with more on the subject here : deal with setback — how to stay fit while injure or sick .
1. limit total workout volume .
unless you be an exercise science guru , exercise volume may be a new concept .
we will go over the basic and then show you how to apply it to your workout routine .
exercise calculation , like volume , can be use as a method to measure workout intensity .
generally , volume be calculate use this equation : workout volume = ( the amount of weight that you be lift ) x ( number of set ) x ( repetition ) for example , if you lift 20 lb ( 9 kg ) on the overhead shoulder press for 3 set of 10 repetition , then your workout volume would be ( 20 lb ) x ( 3 set ) x ( 10 rep ) = 600 lb ( 272 kg ) for that particular exercise .
when you be injured , your workout volume should always be less than your pre - injury volume .
to calculate this , modify one ( or all ) of the variable in the above equation .
some example of way in which you can change your training volume include : decrease the number of set you perform limit the number of repetition you do low the amount of weight you lift the good news be that you can work out and maintain fitness level even if you need to temporarily lower your workout volume .
by do so , you be significantly decrease your risk for great injury and reduce the possibility of weakness from inactivity .
2. modify your positioning or lifting technique .
depend on the type of injury you sustain , you may need to modify your body position or lifting technique .
for example , deep squat should be avoid for people with hip , knee , ankle , or low back injury .
instead , take a wide stance and practice mini - squat or wall slide .
people who be recover from shoulder and neck injury should avoid overhead motion and prioritize shoulder stabilization exercise or upper back strengthen .
3. give yourself more time to recover between set .
consider take more time to rest between rep , set , and workout day .
rest period be an underutilized factor when it come to modify an exercise routine , especially while recover from an injury .
many people use short rest period to increase the intensity of the workout ; however , increase the length of the rest period can have the opposite effect ( i.e .
, allow for low intensity ) .
4. focus on unilateral movement to strengthen the weakened area .
unilateral movement be a common term use to describe motion that involve one side of the body .
incorporate them into a workout be an effective way to address weakness and instability in the body .
oftentimes , unilateral movement target important accessory muscle that work to stabilize your body when do large movement .
some example of unilateral movement include : lunge step ups lie leg lift clamshell single leg bridge single leg rdls ( romanian dead lift ) single arm shoulder press bent over dumbbell row dumbbell chest press dumbbell bicep curl 5. consider do different form of exercise while you recover .
look on the bright side : sometimes the `` best `` part of an injury be discover a new activity that you otherwise would have never attempt .
and one of the most effective way to maintain fitness level when you be injure be through something call cross training .
cross training involve participate in similar type of exercise to develop a specific component of fitness .
you may have hear this term reference by marathon runner or triathlon participant , since it be a widely - use method to improve cardiovascular health and endurance .
while these athlete use cross training as a way to rest their body from repetitive motion , you can use it as a way to stay physically active during recovery .
for example , those who be unable to run or jog may prefer to swim or row , since the latter be less jar to the joint in the low body .
similarly , people who suffer from wrist and hand injury may not be able to tolerate cycling and , instead , should jog or go for a brisk walk .
6. work through a pain - free range of motion .
this go without say , but let be take a second to discuss why this be important .
pain with movement be a sign that something be not right .
along with that , any strong , sharp , or persistent pain that develop during exercise should be consider as a red flag and cause for concern .
if you notice pain or discomfort with movement , especially as you be recover from an injury , either stop what you be do or modify your movement .
suggestion on how to modify the movement include change the activity , decrease your range of motion , or limit your rep / set .
7. cautiously reintroduce new exercise .
our body tend to gravitate towards certain pattern of movement .
over time , the body become adept at those particular movement pattern , which increase our vulnerability to injury when do something new .
therefore , when introduce new exercise after an injury , you should move cautiously and with purpose .
the concept of movement pattern be not new , and physical therapist frequently use this principle to help people recover from injury .
you can also take advantage of this by strengthen weaken area of the body use multiple form of the same exercise .
one example of this would be to perform side and reverse lunge in addition to forward lunge .
8. substitute pain - free exercise for painful one be okay .
like cross training , substitute pain - free exercise for painful one be another way to maintain your fitness level as you recover from an injury .
unable to lie flat for bench press ?
strengthen the chest muscle by do an incline press or weight push - ups instead .
sore wrist during plank ?
drop down to your elbow or make a fist .
9. do not be afraid to take some time off .
admittedly , there be time when the modification on this list be not enough .
if that be the case , then it be best to take some time off from exercise or see a specialist .
in the meantime , focus on your body be strengths and exercise that you can perform without pain or limitation .
yoga , walking , and gentle pool exercise be often great alternative to strength or hiit workout .
10. ease back into exercise after recovery .
once you be ready to start exercise again , it be best to ease back into it .
avoid the temptation to load the same amount of weight that you use before the injury , and fight the urge to do your usual rep / set scheme .
gradually reintroduce movement and strengthening exercise be the best way to prevent reinjury .
use low rep and set so you can focus on form , control , and stability .
as always , prioritize core stabilization exercise to ensure that your foundation remain strong and healthy .
final thought .
recover from an injury can be frustrating , but it do not have to signal the end of your workout day .
find way to exercise in a pain - free manner that do not place you at further risk for harm .
use some , or all , of the modification list above , and share your best tip for return from an injury with us below in the comment section .
< END > < START > if you be recover from an injury , have a mild disability that prevents you from do certain move , have bad knee or be suffer from back pain and you want to avoid high impact exercise but you still want to stay active and try some of the workout from this website , try these modification .
the modification will also be suitable if you be try to keep the noise you make to a minimum – it be handy if you live in an apartment and your neighbour be … not very understanding people .
reduce the pressure you put on your knee by replace high knee with march step and jump jack with step jack : cardio modification reduce the pressure put on your knee by replace squat with wall squat and jump squat with floor tap : squat modification take the pressure off your shoulder and upper body during push - ups by replace them with knee push - ups , wall push - ups or incline push - ups : modification / exercise alternative - pull - ups replace mountain climber with cross climber or towel slide climber to reduce noise and the pressure you put on your knee : modification / exercise alternative - climber use a sofa to elevate your static and/or dynamic plank if you find them too hard or if you struggle with a lot of extra weight .
modification / exercise alternative - plank add equipment this resource be design to make fitness as accessible as possible , make it easy to start and continue with training on a daily basis indefinitely and make it part of your lifestyle – without spend any money and without any special equipment .
all workout here be almost entirely base on bodyweight exercise and whatever else you can find and make into a piece of equipment ( box , basket , chair etc . )
.
you can add equipment to the routine if you have it on hand , though , to make our routine more challenging .
you can use equipment , but you do not have to .
it be a personal thing , and once you be use to regular training you will be able to tell whether you need to add something extra or not .
if you be a beginner , we strongly suggest that you do not buy anything until you have do at least two month worth of training to know you will use the extra equipment and it will not just gather dust in the corner .
do not waste any money unless you be absolutely sure you need something and you will use it .
add dumbbell to : squat , lunge , side lunge , punch , cross chop , arm raise , sit twist and get - ups .
dumbbell dumbbells hack : instead of dumbbell you can use two plastic bottle and fill them with water or sand .
dumbbell be perhaps the one of few piece of equipment that be worth buy - as long as you make sure you use them regularly .
place them in front of the tv , you can do 10 - 20 basic biceps curl while you be watch your favourite show .
never , ever put them away – otherwise you will create an out - of - sight , out - of - mind situation .
even if you have to trip over them every time you go to the kitchen , it will still be a constant reminder that they be there , if you need them and you need them right now .
modify chop : chop add sandbag to : squat , lunge and push - ups sandbag any old gym bag can be turn into a sand bag and any laundry basket fill with book into a piece of lift equipment – use your imagination .
replace bicep extension with dumbbell curl or resistant band curl : work biceps with bodyweight train add ankle and wrist weight for additional difficulty ankle weight be best for : flutter kick , side leg raise , slow climber , leg raise , kick wrist weight be best for : punching , raise arm circle , punch and overhead punch < END > < START > alternative to run while injured injury afflict most of us at some point .
when address early , many injury can be resolve with rest and training plan adjustment .
but more serious injury may require month away from run .
how can you best stay fit during all that time off ?
no athlete want to be sideline by an injury .
running may be what you love best , but in order to help yourself come back strong time out be essential .
it be extremely important to allow time to heal and focus on a comprehensive rehabilitation program .
if we fail to do his we find ourselves in a vicious circle of early return to activity and re injury .
this make the process a lot long and ultimately far more distressing .
it be vital to honor the body and remember that stay active fit and healthy be something we prioritize for life .
with that important perspective shift we can accept that recovery break be temporary , necessary and vital .
so while the process of rehabilitation take place we can focus on what we can do .
both endurance - orient cross - training and strength work can be use to maintain your aerobic fitness and strengthen the supportive structure that help you move injury - free .
certain type of cross - training such as pool running , cycling and the elliptical be the most effective for aerobic exercise and can support aerobic conditioning for return running .
type of cross - training , such as strength training , swimming and pilate , be more complementary to run .
always follow your physiotherapist guideline as to what type of cross - training be suitable to your injury and recovery process .
pool run if you be injured and unable to perform any weight - bearing exercise , aqua jogging should be your go - to method for maintain fitness .
of all type of cross - training , pool running be the most running specific .
this mean it be most similar to actual running in respect to your movement and biomechanics .
you can replicate just about any type of run workout in the pool , from tempo to interval to long run .
so what be the down side of pool run ?
it be not terribly excite , especially if you be try to push through a 2 - hour long run .
but if you can hang in there with a little monotony , you will see the benefit when you be able to hit the road again .
cycle cycling be another type of cross - training that be particularly runner specific .
because it be a non - weight bearing exercise , injured runner can often cycle pain - free .
like pool running , it provide a perfect opportunity to replicate workout such as tempo and interval .
cycling help strengthen the quad , out hip and glute , which all tend to be weaker in runner .
when replace a running session with a cycling workout , 10–15 minute on the bike be roughly the equivalent of run one mile .
try to keep your cadence at about 90 + rpm ( rotation per minute ) , as this help mimic a running stride .
elliptical a third cross - training option that be also runner - specific and low - impact be the elliptical .
work out on an elliptical closely mimic your run movement with little - to - no impact on your joint .
make sure to use enough resistance to get your heart rate elevate for an aerobic workout .
like pool running , ellipticals can also be a little monotonous .
an alternative , if available , be the assault bike .
a number of elite runner have use these as a supplement to their training .
they have all the benefit of an elliptical machine while allow you break the monotony .
train strength training be a broad term that encompass everything from core exercise to bodyweight workout to lift weight at the gym .
whether you be injure or not , strength training should be a part of every runner be routine .
but if you ca not run , now be an excellent time to get strong and more resilient glute and hip be a common weak area for runner , which can lead to a multitude of injury .
strengthen these area be essential to healthy running .
if you be new to strength training , bodyweight routine and machine weight machine be a perfect way to get start .
add repetition as you improve , and gradually progress to use heavy weight under the guidance of our physiotherapist .
swim swimming be an outstanding full - body workout with no impact .
while it may be challenge to get a true aerobic workout from swim unless you be already a proficient swimmer , it can add variety to the type of training describe above .
if you have a new or nagging injury , you can substitute in a 30–45 minute swim once a week to help maintain aerobic fitness .
pilate pilate can be a great complement to endurance training and will help work some mobility back into tight , inflexible muscle and joint .
pilate have a strong emphasis on core strength and stability which improve pelvic stability during run .
with its emphasis on focused breath and movement no matter the pace , pilate can also develop your body awareness .
although get injured may temporarily take you away from the sport you love , know that what with a commitment to rehabilitation you will improve fitness and strength meaning you will come back strong than ever .
< END > < START > if you be look for an exercise program to help you effectively build mass , you may be look for something to do with hypertrophy training .
similar to classic strength training , the goal of hypertrophy be different .
one focus on building strength and the other on build muscle mass .
hypertrophy be define as `` the enlargement of skeletal muscle fiber in response to be recruit to develop increased level of tension , as see in resistance training .
[ it ] be characterize by an increase in the cross - sectional area of individual muscle fiber result from an increase in myofibril protein ( myofilaments ) .
” specific adaptation to impose demand ( say ) principle state that adaptation be specific to the imposed stimulus .
if the demand be not place on the muscle over time the muscle will begin to atrophy .
what be hypertrophy ?
research indicate that perform approximately 15 - 20 set of challenge hypertrophy exercise per week be the optimum stimulus to enhance muscle size .
since maximal muscle response be achieve through 5 - 6 set of a specific exercise , it be best to spread the workload throughout the week .
this mean that train beyond the maximal growth stimulus you will disrupt the stimulus - recovery - adaptation curve by delay the recovery phase , which be counterproductive to muscle growth .
first , consider a variety of different exercise .
since muscle damage be a function of loading and tension , high tension and high damage exercise will require more time for recovery .
these exercise will also stimulate strong muscle adaptation that will effectively enable it to withstand more tension in subsequent training .
for example , do five set of heavy bench press will cause far more muscle breakdown than 5 set of pushup .
high - tension and high - damage exercise , therefore , require more recovery time but cause great adaptation .
exercise feature an increased range of motion , more time under tension , a great load , and a longer eccentric portion be typically the preferred stimulus to maximize muscle hypertrophy .
muscle hypertrophy be also a function of maximal voluntary isometric contraction and load / unloading .
in other word , the more muscle fiber you can activate through a specific exercise and loading , the great the demand ( stimulus ) and therefore the great the hypertrophy response .
mechanism for hypertrophy & muscular development 1 ) exercise - induced muscle damage during eccentric activity , the contractile element ( actin and myosin ) in work muscle exert a resistance action that produce small tear in both the contractile element and surface membrane ( sarcolemma ) of the associated muscle fiber .
the subsequent muscle repair ( recovery ) strengthen the tissue to protect against further damage ( adaptation ) .
2 ) metabolic stress metabolic stress result from the buildup of various metabolite ( e.g .
, lactic acid , inorganic phosphate , etc . )
, primarily because of training in the fast glycolytic energy system where carbohydrate be use anaerobically to fuel performance .
3 ) mechanical tension ( force ) refer to the amount of force / tension within the muscle fiber in response to a static or dynamic stimulus .
the reaction increase protein synthesis and muscle size .
the goal be to activate as many muscle fiber as possible to maximize the response .
4 ) fascia stretch training pump specific muscle group full of oxygenated blood in a relatively short period of time , force the fascia tissue to stretch and expand like a balloon .
this pack nutrient and oxygen rich blood into and around the muscle cell to promote repair and growth .
speaking of stretch , you can learn more about its relationship with hypertrophy below .
how to train for hypertrophy – rep range and set hypertrophy / muscular development training be typically moderate - heavy loading ( 75 - 85 percent 1rm ) ,6 - 12 rep , 2 - 0 - 2 , 0 - 60 or 0 - 30 rest , 3 - 6 set ( up to 7 ) , 2 - 4 strength exercise per body part .
muscular development podcast ad opt model pyramid set – the volume of set can be modify over time as your training progress .
start out , try shoot for 3 set of a few different exercise for each major muscle group ( or complex movement ) .
for intermediate lifter , increase your set volume to 4 - 6 set .
for advanced lifter or athlete , it be common to see as many as 6 - 7 work set per exercise .
rep – similar to set , rep be an opportunity to manipulate training volume .
for strength hypertrophy , 6 - 12 rep with moderately heavy load 75 - 85 percent 1rm be most effective .
for the best all - around workout , i recommend pyramid up in weight over the course of your work set .
this will maximize hypertrophy and still work the high and low end of the spectrum .
force – loading ( percent 1rm ) time under tension ( tut ) – length of time the muscle stimulus create tension cadence – this be the timing of your concentric and eccentric motion during a lift .
this can vary depend on the specific goal .
for example , stability and strength - endurance type of exercise may use a 4/2/1 ( second ) tempo ( eccentric / isometric stabilization / concentric ) whereas the typical cadence for hypertrophy training be 2/0/2 .
rest interval – another often overlook acute variable be rest interval .
this refer to the rest between set .
for most training , 0 - 60 second be sufficient to replenish 85 to 90 percent of atp and pc and keep your muscle pump up .
for strength endurance and stabilization , 0 - 90 second be recommend .
if you be train for maximal strength / powerlifting , be sure to rest 3 - 5 min between set to ensure your system be fully recover .
vertical v horizontal loading : there be several different way to execute your hypertrophy training .
horizontal loading be the most common .
in horizontal loading , each exercise or muscle group be completely train before move on to the next exercise .
vertical loading be often see in circuit training when each circuit be comprise of a sequence of back - to - back exercise .
( i.e .
, chest press > squat > row , repeat ) .
both have benefit and serve different purpose .
for most hypertrophy training and those chase the pump , horizontal loading be usually the best to keep the specific muscle ( s ) flood with oxygenated blood and nutrient and maximize tension .
progressive overloading : remember , your body be always in a state of adaptation .
you want to improve your cardiovascular performance and vo2 threshold , you will want to stress and challenge that area of the nervous system .
if you want to improve your maximal strength ( i.e .
, powerlifting ) , you will need to train low rep , heavy load to create that specific adaptation .
the key be to shift training phase every 3 - 4 week ( or as need ) to create muscle confusion and force your body to continuously adapt to the stress place upon it .
a decrease in load ( unload ) over an extended period can cause muscle atrophy - a loss in skeletal muscle mass and strength .
with consistent train the body will adapt to the progression and meet the demand of the stress place upon it .
* note that mechanisms such as progressive overload allow you to remain in a specific phase ( i.e .
, hypertrophy / muscular development for bodybuilding ) for long period without risk a plateau .
< END > < START > there be so many way to customize dumbbell workout , too .

< END > < START > benefit of barbell exercise 1. they be ideal for gain strength .
there be three main reason barbell exercise be ideal for build strength : 1. one of the best way to get strong be to train with heavy weight .
when you use dumbbell , you can only progress up to the heavy dumbbell available in your gym ( usually around 100 pound ) , but no far .
while this be plenty to progress on most exercise , it will not be enough to achieve progressive overload on exercise like the squat , deadlift , bench press , and dumbbell row after several year of proper training .
with a barbell , though , you can push , pull , and squat far more weight than you ever could with dumbbell .
not only be barbell physically strong than dumbbell ( some can hold over 3,000 pound ) , but they also allow you to put your body in a position where you can lift heavy weight more efficiently ( for instance , the barbell squat vs the goblet squat ) .
thus , you can get strong with barbell exercise far long than you can with dumbbell .
2. with most barbell exercise , you be able to use both hand to keep the bar stable and the weight evenly distribute over both the left and right side of your body , which make it easy to push and pull heavy load than with dumbbell .
for example , in the dumbbell bench press , you have to consciously fight to keep both of your hand about the same distance from your chest , whereas this mostly take care of itself when do the barbell bench press .
3. the exercise that allow you to handle the heavy weight , such as the squat , deadlift , and bench and overhead press , be easy to perform with a barbell .
you can perform these exercise with dumbbell , but once the dumbbell get heavy ( over 75 pound ) , they become unwieldy , awkward , and at time , unsafe .
2. they be adaptable .
barbell can be use for many different type of exercise , include ... bodybuilding powerlifting strongman crossfit olympic weightlifting ... which mean that no matter how you like to train , you can almost always use a barbell .
3. they allow you to perform exercise safely .
because your hand be “ locked ” in position during barbell exercise , you tend to have more control over a barbell than you do when you use dumbbell , which typically make exercise safer .
what be more , you often have to “ nudge , ” “ flick , ” or “ clean ” dumbbell to get them into the proper position to perform an exercise .
for example , in the dumbbell shoulder press , you have to lift the dumbbell onto your thigh then “ kick ” them up to shoulder height to get into the starting position .
set up like this be not so bad when the dumbbell be light , but it begin to feel unsteady and fatigue as the weight get heavy ( usually over 50 pound or so for men and 25 for woman ) .
get in position be not as precarious for most compound barbell exercise because they generally involve a power rack .
this allow you to quickly get into a safe and efficient position before bear any weight .
( use a squat rack also make it safe to drop the bar if you happen to hit failure on most barbell exercise . )
4. they allow you to increase weight in small increment .
increase the weight you lift over time — also know as progressive overload — be the most important driver of strength and muscle gain .
most dumbbell go up in 5 - pound increment , which mean when you increase the weight for a dumbbell exercise , you typically have to lift a minimum of 10 pound more than you previously do ( each dumbbell weigh 5 pound more than the previous one you use ) .
when you be new to weightlift , 10 - pound jump from week to week be easy .
as you nudge your genetic limit for muscle and strength gain , however , you will not be able to progress this quickly , and you will need to increase the weight more gradually .
most gym have barbell plate as small as 2.5 pound , which allow you to make small , more sustainable , 5 - pound increase that allow you to keep get strong without become plateaued or injure .

2. close - grip barbell bench press close - grip barbell bench press the close - grip bench press be most people be go - to barbell tricep exercise because it allow you to safely and effectively train all three head of the triceps with heavy weight ( which can be difficult with other triceps exercise , like the skullcrusher ) .
how to : lie on a flat bench , pull your shoulder blades together and down , and without lift your butt or shoulder off the bench , slightly arch your back .
grab the bar with a shoulder - width grip or slightly narrow and unrack the barbell so it be directly above your chest .
bring the barbell to your low chest while keep your elbow tuck at about a 30 - degree angle relative to your torso .
when the bar touch your chest , explosively press the bar back to the start position .
3. lie barbell triceps extension ( “ skullcrusher ” ) skullcrusher the lie barbell triceps extension ( aka the “ skullcrusher ” ) be a great barbell exercise for arm because it train the slightly small medial and lateral head of the triceps , ensure you have define , proportional upper arm .
although you could say this exercise involve an e - z bar and not a regular barbell , an e - z bar be simply a slightly light barbell with a slanted grip .
how to : while lie on a flat bench , hold a barbell above your chest with a shoulder - width grip .
bend your elbow and low the bar until it be right above your forehead , and then reverse the movement to return to the start position .
( tip : if you want to increase the range of motion of this exercise , low the bar behind your head until it be almost touch the bench . )
the best barbell ab exercise 1. barbell landmine rainbow barbell landmine rainbow the barbell landmine rainbow be a great barbell core exercise because it force you to stabilize your core muscle under load , which build the type of core strength and stability you need if you play sport that require you to twist and turn at speed .
how to : place one end of an empty barbell in a landmine attachment or wedge it into the corner of the room and load the other end with weight plate .
while face the weighted end of the barbell , use both hand to hoist the barbell up to chest height .
press the bar overhead , then keep your arm straight , low the bar down toward your left hip , pivot your right foot inward as you lower the bar .
use your core , drive the bar in an arch until it be back overhead , then low it down toward your right hip , pivot your left foot inward as you lower the bar .
continue to alternate from side to side for the desired number of reps. 2. barbell rollout barbell rollout study show that the barbell rollout be an extremely effective exercise for train all part of the ab and core , especially the rectus abdominis and the oblique .
how to : kneel down on the floor with a load barbell in front of you .
with your arm fully extend , grab the barbell and slowly roll it away from you .
brace your core tightly so that your torso remain rigid and your low back flat .
roll the barbell until your body be as close to parallel with the floor as possible then roll yourself back to the start position by flex your ab .
tip : start with your knee and foot in contact with the floor , but as you get strong you can cross your foot and lift them off the floor a few inch to make the exercise more difficult .
3. barbell sit - up barbell sit - up the big benefit of the barbell sit - up be it be easy to add weight to .
be able to add weight to “ sit - up ” exercise increase their effectiveness and allow you to take advantage of progressive overload ( which be the most important driver of muscle growth ) .
how to : lie on a sit - up bench with your foot wedge under the foot pad .
use both hand , hold a barbell directly above your chest with your arm straight .
keep your arm perpendicular to the floor and your back flat , use your ab muscle to lift your chest toward the ceiling until your low back come completely off the bench .
reverse the movement and return to the start position .
< END > < START > he classic barbell be a mainstay in fitness and human performance .
its beauty be in its simplicity and effectiveness , which make it the best piece of train equipment you can own .
in fact , it be all you need .
you do not even have to have many exercise to get an insane workout .
here be the 12 top barbell exercise to do , and simple variation to help spice up your routine .
the article cover : how to use the barbell for muscle growth and strength development benefit of barbell train 12 best barbell exercise and variation 4 - day barbell workout plan nutrition tip for optimal training and result bar exercise what be a barbell ?
we first need to clarify what a barbell be .
barbell be comprise of a long , solid piece of metal with two thicker piece on the end know as collar to load the barbell .
over the year , barbell have evolve in size and function .
today , there be a few common style , include olympic barbell , squat barbell , and power barbell .
generally speak , the olympic barbell be the most common style in a typical gym .
these come in two size : men be olympic barbell : 7.2 foot long and 44 pound with a 1.1 - inch diameter woman be olympic barbell : 6.5 ft long and 33 pound with a 0.98 - inch diameter benefit of barbell exercise there be a reason barbell training be the primary method for anyone serious about building strength and gaining muscle mass .
you need to include more barbell exercise in your training program , and here be why .
1. barbell be highly versatile : the barbell be simply a tool to create an artificial load .
be so , there be very few limitation on how you can use one to perform an exercise .
this mean that you can train the entire body with just a barbell .
every muscle group can be hit with this one piece of equipment , and all of the best compound exercise can incorporate a barbell .
therefore , you need just a barbell pair with chin - ups to train the entire body .
2. barbell training be cost effective : due to barbell be so versatile , they be easily the most cost - effective mean if you want to train at home .
the only other piece of equipment you would need to buy be : weight plate for load a squat rack or power rack weight bench you can buy all that for the price of one machine that only train one movement pattern .
3. you use more muscle mass : the majority of barbell exercise consist of multi - joint movement , as that be what they be design to do .
in other word , they be design to train multiple large muscle group at once .
while machine allow compound movement , barbell do a good job of strengthen stabilizer muscle group .
these be muscle that support our primary muscle and provide balance .
4. barbell exercise be more functional : barbell be free weight that allow you to replicate the basic movement pattern one see in real life , such as push , pull , stand up , and kneeling .
far , barbell train require balance and high activation in the stabilizer muscle because the barbell be a free weight .
this more realistically mimic real life .
5. easy to use progressive load : progressive overload be the key to building strength and muscle mass .
because barbell be load with plate and use a definite weight , it be easy to monitor your progress and apply heavy load .
advanced lifter can even get microplates , which be weight plate that weigh a fraction of a pound .
these be essential to provide a minimal increase in weight .
6. barbell exercise stimulate high increase in hormone : resistance training , in general , be go to improve your hormone level .
in fact , just be physically active will have a positive effect when compare to be sedentary .
that say , use heavy compound lift be superior and create a large secretion of hormone .
and recent research show that when compare barbell movement to a similar machine movement ( i.e .
, squat vs. leg press ) , the barbell release a great amount¹ .
7. you burn more calorie with barbell training : we firmly believe that the primary purpose for weight lift fall under a few category : stimulate muscle growth or building strength maintain muscle mass or strength improve performance variable such as power output in other word , you do not choose an exercise for weight loss .
create a caloric deficit , like through a cut workout and diet plan , along with eat the best food for muscle be your primary mean of control your weight .
that say , weight training do burn calorie , and because barbell allow heavy load and use so much muscle mass , it burn more calorie .
do not think of this as the reason to use barbell training ; rather , it be more like a sweet little bonus .
main muscle group your body have a lot of muscle , and each one be hit with barbell training .
because we cover a lot in this article , we will briefly review them with basic description .
however , we encourage you to take the time to learn anatomy more in - depth .
chest : the chest consists of several major muscle that can be hit with all type of equipment range from dumbbell exercise to cable chest exercise to the barbell move we be about to get into .
bar weight exercise pectoralis major : the pectoralis major consists of the upper chest ( clavicular head ) and low chest ( sternocostal head ) .
these be the primary mover for upper body push motion .
pectoralis minor : a small muscle that lay underneath the pectoralis major near the upper chest and connect the arm .
intercostal : a group of several muscle that run between the rib and allow respiration .
back : the back muscle be responsible for pull , extend the spine , and provide structure to the torso , always work in unison .
in other word , basically any compound back exercise be go to train every back muscle .
barbell lift the major back muscle be : lat : this be the large muscle of the upper body .
the lat run down the spine and pull the shoulder down and back , like in the lat pull - down exercise .
trap : the trap consist of three part .
in totality , the trap connect to the base of the skull and run down approximately 1/3 of the back .
they then fan out to the shoulder .
these 4 point give them an appearance of a trapezoid hence their name .
rhomboid : comprise of two muscle , rhomboid major and rhomboid minor , they be responsible for retract , elevate , and rotate the shoulder blade .
the two muscle form a rhomboid shape on the upper - middle back .
erector spinae : the erector spinae begin near the end of the spine and run up about 2/3 of the way .
as it travel up , it branch off into three `` finger `` on each side .
shoulder : the shoulder muscle , also know as the deltoid , consist of three muscle head .
together , these three muscle fully manipulate the arm .
different shoulder exercise target separate part of the shoulder , but a few stand - out move , like the overhead press , hit all the muscle head at once .
best barbell exercise the shoulder muscle include : anterior deltoid ( front shoulder muscle ) lateral deltoid ( middle shoulder muscle on the outside of the shoulder ) posterior deltoid ( rear shoulder muscle ) arm : the arm consist of two section : the upper arm and low arm .
bar lift exercise together , there be basically three different muscle grouping : biceps : these upper arm muscle flex the elbow and manipulate the forearm .
triceps : these upper arm muscle be responsible for extend the elbow .
forearm muscle : they manipulate the hand and be responsible for grip strength .
glute : ﻿the glute be a set of three muscle that sit on the buttock .
together , these muscle be the strong in the human body and be primarily responsible for hip extension .
they also play a role in virtually every movement the human body make .
and as a bonus , they can also make your jean look phenomenal , which be probably why butt - lifting exercise be so popular .
bar lift workout gluteus maximus : the large and strong of the 3 muscle , it act as the primary hip extensor .
gluteus medius : the gluteus medius sits on the outside of the leg and be responsible for hip abduction .
far , it play a large role in balance , especially on one leg .
gluteus minimus : the gluteus minimus sits under the gluteus minimus and have virtually the same role .
hamstring : the hamstring sit on the posterior of the upper leg and consist of 3 muscle .
together , they be the primary knee flexor and play a role in hip extension .
you will see one or both of these movement in the best hamstring exercise .
barbell strength train semitendinosus semimembranosus biceps femoris quadriceps : the quadriceps contain four muscle that sit on the front of the upper thigh .
together , these muscle work together in quad exercise and in daily life as the primary knee extender .
bench press bar exercise they include : rectus femoris vastus lateralis vastus intermedius vastus medialis the rectus femoris be the only quadricep muscle involve in hip flexion .
the best barbell movement when we look at the human body , there be several primary movement that we want to try to replicate , make pull exercise , push workout , squat , lunging , and hinge crucial for any routine .
vertical pulling : we be start with the only movement impossible to replicate with a barbell , and that be vertical pulling .
vertical pull refers to exercise in which the arm grab an object from overhead and pull it toward the body .
horizontal pulling : horizontal pulling be when you pull an object toward your body .
all of the back muscle and biceps be involve in horizontal pulling .
vertical push : vertical push occurs when you have an object overhead such as in the overhead press when you press the barbell overhead .
the muscle train be the shoulder , chest , and triceps .
horizontal push : horizontal push occurs when you push an object away from the body , such as in the bench press .
the muscle train be the chest , shoulder , and triceps .
squat : many people confuse squat and hip - hinge .
the main distinguishing factor be movement and flexion of the knee .
when the knee come forward and involve more knee extension ( quadriceps activation ) , it be a squat .
hip - hinge : compare to the squat , in a true hip - hinge , the knee stay stationary and the shin vertical .
the primary joint be the hip , with the posterior muscle be the primary mover .
the main muscle work be the glute and hamstring .
however , the erector spinae often play a role in many hip - hinge movement .
lunge : a lunge be a movement in which a person take a step forward with one foot and then lower the body .
lunge exercise train every muscle in the low body as well as improve balance .
there be also several type of lunge , such as the reverse lunge , which will hit the muscle differently .
the best barbell exercise for upper and low body training we will break down the best barbell exercise into the upper and low body to keep thing organize .
top upper body barbell exercise first on the list be the best barbell exercise for the upper body .
these barbell exercise will train the muscle that make up the chest , shoulder , back , and arm .
1. overhead press : straight bar workouts the stand barbell overhead press be probably the most underused barbell movement on this list , likely due to its difficulty .
it involve press a load barbell straight overhead from the chest , and lock out the arm .
a cool fact about the overhead press be that it be actually an original movement in olympic weightlifting .
it be eventually take out due to difficulty keep standard for correct form ( athlete begin bend the back to extreme ) , but its legacy remain .
the overhead press might be the most challenging barbell exercise there be , but it will cause your upper body strength to blow up .
worth it !
how to do the overhead press : set up an empty barbell on a rack .
the bar should be place low than shoulder height around the middle pecs .
you do not want to get on your tippy toe , so if you have to choose , set the bar so it be near your low pec muscle rather than your upper chest .
place your hand shoulder - width apart use an overhand grip .
get under the barbell with your elbow push in front of the barbell .
your thumb should be touch the outside of the shoulder with the barbell rest on the clavicle and deltoid .
extend your leg , unrack the barbell , and take 2 step back .
at this point , be sure the barbell be rest on your body .
many new lifter will hold the barbell off the chest , which eat up energy .
tighten the core muscle and glute to create a firm base .
when ready , drive the straight barbell overhead .
as the bar reach the head , tuck it back until the bar pass and then pop it back in place .
this allow the barbell to travel in a straight line .
finish drive the bar straight above the head until your elbow be extend with the weight overhead .
2. barbell bench press : barbell bench exercise let be get into the horizontal press now .
perhaps the most popular barbell exercise , the barbell bench press be also one of the most misunderstood .
it be an amazing movement to improve the push strength and the upper body be overall musculature .
however , it be not necessarily the great chest movement as many make it out to be .
the flat barbell bench press do train the chest , but it be actually more effective in increase the size and strength of the triceps .
still , it remain one of the best barbell exercise because it be fundamental in provide a solid base to work from .
you can also adjust your hand position , change your barbell bench press grip to target different upper body muscle during the exercise .
we will also include several variation after our how - to , along with any modification you need to make .
how to do the barbell bench press : set up a bench and load the barbell .
lay down on the bench with your eye directly beneath the barbell .
grab the barbell wider slightly than shoulder - width apart .
the barbell should sit in the crease of the thumb .
to do this , reach your hand around the barbell .
this will help keep your wrist straight during the movement .
before unracking the barbell , dig your shoulder blade into the mat .
next , tuck your foot back .
this do not need to be extreme , but you should have minimal tuck .
this position cause your body to become much more stable and solid .
unrack the barbell and bring it forward , so your arm be straight .
this place it above your upper chest .
slowly low the barbell down toward your low chest .
this mean the barbell bench press be one of the few exercise in which the barbell do not travel straight .
as the barbell lower , keep your elbow tuck at a 45 - degree angle .
let the barbell touch your chest and then drive it back up .
as you drive the barbell up , it make a `` j `` as it travel up and back .
incline barbell bench press variation : most will put the bench at 45 - degree angle .
however , play around with small angle as well .
the only difference be the barbell will come down high on your chest , and the incline will hit the upper chest more .
decline bench press variation : again , experiment with various angle but the max should be 45 - degree .
the barbell will come down on your low chest , and the decline will target the low chest to a high degree .
close grip bench press variation : for the close grip bench press , grab the barbell slightly narrow than shoulder width apart .
as the barbell come down , be sure to tuck your elbow .
this create great flexion of the elbow while lessen the activity of the chest .
wide grip bench press variation : place your hand wider than a traditional grip .
this will cause less flexion in the elbow and great activation in the chest .
3. barbell bent over row : exercise with barbell weight let be hit those back muscle now , shall we ?
the barbell bent over row should be your primary exercise for build your back muscle .
it be really that simple .
this single movement be go to hit every single muscle in your entire back .
if that be not enough , the bent - over row do a lot more , include train your biceps , particularly with an underhand grip , require an intense isometric contraction in your posterior chain ( erector spinae , glute , hamstring ) , and need total core activation to support be bent over .
there be several barbell bent over row grip , and utilize all of them will help you target each of the major back muscle differently .
pay attention to the start position for the bent - over row .
it tend to be very difficult for some people , so take your time when first training .
how to do the barbell bent over row : load a barbell on the ground and stand in the middle with a comfortable stance .
your foot should be somewhere between shoulder width apart and hip width stance .
bend down and use and grab the barbell with hand slightly wide than shoulder - width apart and an overhand grip .
this prep portion should look similar to a deadlift .
stand up erect .
now time for the starting position .
push the hip back slightly and lean your torso forward while bend your knee slightly .
pull your shoulder blade back to maintain a straight , ridge back .
keep come down while keep a slight bend in your knee .
you must drop the torso forward enough that the arm hang freely in front of your knee .
try to get your torso as parallel to the ground as possible .
the more parallel you get , the more emphasis you place on the back .
when ready , brace and pull the barbell up to the belly .
as you pull , have your elbow bent at a 45 - degree angle .
think about pull your elbow to the ceiling rather than pull the barbell up .
this will encourage proper form and maximal use of the back muscle .
pull all the way up and then slowly low the barbell .
variation : use an underhand grip shoulder width apart , which be more narrow than the traditional grip .
your arm should slide against your body straight back , create great flexion in the elbow ( great bicep activation ) and increase your range of motion .
top low body barbell exercise now , it be time for the low half .
when use a barbell to train the low body , you will hit every muscle in every movement .
however , we still have more than one exercise due to how different movement activate the muscle differently .
1. barbell back squat : type of barbell lift the barbell back squat be the king of low body exercise .
it train the entire low body while place huge stress on the core ( in a good way ) .
the barbell back squat be the best exercise to create strength in the low body .
often see as a competition with the deadlift , these two be separate , but equally awesome , exercise .
that say , we rank it as the no .
1 low body exercise simply because of the much large range of motion see in the knee and hip .
far , the back squat also require significantly more mobility in your low body joint .
how to do the barbell back squat : set up a barbell on either a squat rack or power rack slightly low than shoulder height .
again , you do not want to have to get on your tippy toe to unrack the barbell .
place hand wide than shoulder - width apart with an overhand grip .
get under the barbell and place it on the upper portion of your back at shoulder level .
it should lay across your trap .
unrack the barbell and take two step back .
brace your core and push your hip back to begin the movement .
as you low , aim to have the bar drop straight down .
maintain a tight core and straight back the whole time .
continue drop your hip back but allow your knee to travel forward , ensure they always track over your toe .
continue until the top of your thigh break parallel , and drive back up by push your foot down .
2. barbell deadlift : bar bench workout if the barbell back squat be the king of low body exercise , that would mean the deadlift be the king of all exercise .
while there be definitely room for debate on this , the deadlift be arguably the best of the best barbell exercise .
implement the deadlift into your regular program will greatly strengthen and develop a ton of your major muscle group .
generally list as a low body exercise , the deadlift really stress the entire body , primarily the low body and back .
how to do the barbell deadlift : load a barbell on the ground .
stand next to the barbell with your foot shoulder - width apart .
most people stand too wide so pay attention to this .
the barbell should be over your midfoot and an inch or so away from your shin .
push your hip back to lower your body .
as you low , your shin will come forward slightly and make contact with the barbell .
however , they should be relatively vertical .
continue drop your body so your shoulder drop straight down until you can grab the barbell .
grab the barbell , so your hand be just outside your leg .
pull your shoulder blade back and push your chest forward .
your back should be tight and straight .
be sure to have your foot flat on the ground with your weight spread evenly across your foot .
your arm should parallel your shin and all your joint `` tight .
`` this be the starting position .
when ready , brace your core and drive your foot down to the ground to pull the bar straight up your leg to the knee .
at this point , your back should be at the same angle .
once the barbell pass your knee , you begin to drive your hip forward until your body be erect .
slowly low the weight go down .
use a big weight , you can do a control drop .
you let the bar drop but give some guidance and resistance .
this be to minimize bounce or the bar get away .
there be very few situation in which drop the bar be acceptable .
snatch grip deadlift variation : an effective and easy variation be widen your bar grip and use a snatch grip .
this be roughly 1.5 time your normal grip .
it do not need to be exact , so an easy method be to place your index or middle finger on the outermost ring .
from here , everything else remain the same .
3. barbell hip thrust : barbell rod exercise interestingly , the barbell hip thrust be the only single joint exercise on this list .
however , that joint be the hip and utilize the strong muscle in the human body , the glute .
this mean the load can be place directly on the joint in the hip crease provide a direct force .
in fact , this be the only exercise that do this .
that say , it be basically universally agree that it be the best glute exercise .
how to do the barbell hip thrust : set up a steady bench .
sit in front with your knee bent and upper back dig in the bench .
place a barbell in your hip crease and place your hand on the barbell for balance .
when ready , drive your heel into the ground and drive your hip up .
continue until your torso be 100 percent extend .
slowly low and repeat .
4. barbell forward lunge : full body barbell workout the barbell lunge will switch thing up a bit as it be the only unilateral exercise on this list .
while both leg be involve , the primary muscle activate only occur in one leg .
than give you the ability to identify muscular imbalance , the lunge be perfect for improve balance and move a weight under motion .
how to do the barbell forward lunge : place a barbell on your back or front , similarly to either the front squat or back squat , depend on your preference .
hold the barbell at least wide than shoulder - width apart to help balance .
stand with a neutral stance .
take one big step forward .
you may need to play around to get the right distance .
keep your toe straight , low your body straight down .
as you low to the ground , your knee should begin to form a 90 - degree angle , and the front shin and rear thigh should be vertical as the rear knee hit the floor .
push off the forward leg , return it back to standing .
repeat on the opposite side .
5. barbell front squat : long bar exercise do not be confuse .
when it come to front squat vs. back squat , both may be barbell squat but be rather different in biomechanics and muscle activation .
the front squat get its name as the barbell be place on the front of the body rather than on the back ( which make sense ) .
even though this may only mean the bar placement differs by a few inch , those inch cross the body be center of gravity .
as a result , the body be biomechanics be drastically alter as the body lower to keep the bar over the ankle straight .
for this to occur , the torso remain much more vertical with less hip flexion .
this should create high activation in the quadriceps but the data actually be not that clear .
however , one major benefit be there be less force on the spine² .
plus , there be also serious activation of the core muscle and upper back to prevent it from flop over .
in fact , study even show it generate more muscle activity in the shoulder muscle compare to an overhead squat³ !
how to do the barbell front squat : rack a barbell so that it sit at about mid - chest level .
walk up to the barbell and bend down to get under it .
lift your arm out straight in front of you .
this will cause your anterior deltoid to cause a lump .
the barbell will sit behind this lump .
flex your elbow and reach back to balance the barbell with your hand .
stand up , keep your elbow point out straight .
this be call the front rack position .
step back with foot flat and hip - width apart .
push your hip back to squat .
your torso will remain upright during the front squat to keep the barbell over your foot .
continue drop until the top of your thigh hit parallel .
power back up .
as you rise , focus on drive your elbow up .
this will help maintain an erect torso .
6. barbell romanian deadlift : barbell use the last low body exercise be the romanian deadlift .
this hip hinge movement have a similar movement pattern as the deadlift and use the same muscle .
there be a few major difference , however , include that the start position begin with standing , the hip have great flexion , and the knee be slightly bent .
and finally , the load barbell never touch the ground .
as a result , the romanian deadlift be a much more effective exercise to hit the posterior chain .
how to do the barbell romanian deadlift : load a barbell and stand with foot shoulder - width apart .
low down and grab the bar with an overhand shoulder - width grip or slightly wide .
stand up with a form similar to a deadlift .
this be the starting position .
take a deep breath , and push your hip back , keep a minimal bend in the knee .
pull your shoulder blade back to maintain an erect and ridge back .
start to slowly low the barbell in a straight line down your body .
it do not need to touch your body but should remain close .
as you low , think about build tension in the glute and hamstring .
continue lower but keep the knee slightly bend .
the goal be not to reach the ground but to build tension in the posterior chain .
low until you at least pass the knee slightly .
from here , continue but once your form begin to break , stop .
the easy sign be your back will begin to round , and your shoulder blade will come forward .
once this start to happen , stop .
begin come back up but concentrate on drive your hip forward .
we like to do the concentric portion explosively .
push your hip forward until you be erect back in the starting position .
variation : you can also use the snatch grip with the romanian deadlift .
power barbell exercise every athlete need some power in their training .
here be two of our favorite .
1. power clean and jerk : barbell bench press lie the clean and jerk be an amazing power exercise , combine two movement into one of the most challenging barbell exercise .
while it can take some time to learn , it would benefit any athlete who put in the time and want to improve their strength and lean body mass .
the power clean be easy to perform compare to a full clean as you do not need to drop into a squat .
how to do the power clean and jerk : set up similar to a deadlift but use a grip slightly wide than shoulder width .
push your chest up far so it be more vertical .
you may need to sink your hip more .
begin the movement by drive your foot into the ground and drive up .
your back will remain at the same angle until the barbell pass the knee .
at this point , perform triple extension and forcefully push your hip forward to extend your joint .
immediately perform a power shrug by shrug and allow the barbell to travel up your body .
be sure to bring your elbow up high .
as the bar travel up , drop into a 1/4 squat and pull your body under the bar .
flip your elbow up and catch the barbell in the front rack position .
fully extend your knee .
now , drop slightly ( no more than 1/4 squat ) and then forcefully extend your hip to drive the barbell up .
use your arm to help drive the bar completely overhead as you split your leg so one be in front of the other .
make sure the front leg be fully extend , while the back leg be flex slightly .
fully straighten your arm , fully lock the bar overhead .
2. snatch grip high pull : power barbell exercise the snatch grip high pull a highly effective power movement .
also , it will build a crazy strong upper back .
we like it because it be much simpler to perform than other olympic movement .
at the end of the day , it be a clean without actually catch the bar .
how to do the snatch grip high pull : grab the barbell in a similar manner to the snatch grip deadlift .
you can move the grip slightly narrow if need .
one difference be you want to try to get your chest up high , so you may need to sink your hip low .
begin drive up by drive your foot into the ground .
your upper body will remain the same until the barbell hit your knee .
at this point , you will forcefully implement triple extension drive your hip forward .
as soon as you hit extension , you be perform a power shrug and pull the barbell high .
be sure to keep your elbow elevate high .
instead of catch the barbell , you will simply let it fall to the ground use a control drop .
the best barbell core exercise you probably be not expect to see a core exercise on here , but - surprise !
most barbell exercise people speak about be those perform for the upper and low body .
however , this single barbell exercise be likely the only core exercise you will need to do .
that be why there be only one .
1. the barbell rollout : power barbell workout who need dumbbell ab exercise when you have the barbell rollout ?
the barbell rollout be a rollout do on a barbell rather than one of those little plastic toy .
while those would work , use the barbell have two unique advantage : 1 ) you can add weight plate to load the barbell and increase the intensity , and 2 ) the barbell allow wide hand placement for those who lack shoulder mobility .
how to do the barbell rollout : load a barbell and place it on the ground .
kneel behind it and place your hand wider than shoulder - width apart use an overhand grip .
if your shoulder joint have poor mobility , use a wider grip .
get your entire body over the barbell with your arm straight .
keep your core tight and begin to let the barbell roll out in front of you .
as you low , begin to push the barbell out in front of the body .
continue move down until your body be erect .
you should be very close to the ground .
use your core , pull yourself back up .

< END > < START > 1. ease into the first few week of training i find beginner be ready to crush themselves in their very first workout .
in other word , go too hard , which be not advise .
i recommend that lifter ease into their workout by stop just shy of all - out failure on all exercise , at least for the first two week .
this do not mean you be not train hard , it mean that you be give your body the chance to adjust to the extra stimulus .
the reality be as a beginner you be literally start from nothing .
you can do very basic exercise , with moderate to hard effort , and get good result .
while those beginner gain will last only a few month , it be important not to go too aggressive as it will not help you get anywhere faster .
in fact , it may derail you right out of the gate due to injury , excessive soreness , and the inability to work out multiple time a week because you be too “ beat up ” .
2. focus on complete at least 12 workout in the first 30 day i give all my new client a goal of work out 12 time in their first month .
if they can master carve out time to get 12 workout in ( on average 3 per week ) over a 30 - day period , they will have make the necessary behavior change to stick with go to the gym long - term .
get start as a beginner can be tough , as you need to create a new lifestyle routine to accommodate you go to the gym , work out , and then come home .
if you also have to do that before or after work , you will need to pack a bag and some meal .
like any habit , work out be all about repetition and make consistent practice .
12 workout in 30 day not only provide the muscle with enough stimulus to get strong , but it give you the opportunity to create a whole new system on how to allocate your time .
3. choose 5 - 6 total exercise to do each day i suggest that every beginner find a program that have them do no more than 6 exercise on a single day .
ideally , you would be choose 2 - 4 compound exercise , and another 2 - 3 isolation - type movement to build out a good workout program .
as a beginner , it can be tempt to do every exercise you see on social medium on a single day .
you be constantly bombard by “ new cut - edge workout and exercise ” .
if you train more than 3 day a week , you would simply just add more workout during the week , but still , keep the same number of exercise per workout .
check out these workout idea : 3 - day beginner workout program 2 - day beginner workout program 4. keep workout under 1 hour keep workout under 1 hour i recommend beginner get efficient with their workout , i.e .
do a lot of work in a short amount of time .
the idea be to push yourself hard to get a full workout do in an hour .
beginner often struggle with two thing .
the first be be consistent in the gym , often say they do not have enough time to get three or more workout in during the week .
the second be when they be at the gym , they often have less than optimal workout because they be too busy get distract .
both of these can be solve by have a clear workout program that be design for beginner and can be do in under an hour .
this will keep you focused and feel like you be accomplish a lot by the end of the workout .
once you get three workout a week at an hour each , and you be do all your exercise every workout with efficiency , look to add another workout in the week to take your result to the next level .
i suggest you turn your phone to not disturb mode , and switch over to airplane mode so you can not access social medium or email .
the phone be a huge distraction in the gym .
most lifter will rely on their phone for everything : look at their workout program , texting people during workout , surf social medium , and answer email ( or even take call ) .
6. stay off social medium stay off social medium !
we live in a time where everyone be connect on social medium , and the gym be no different .
too often i see people ( not just beginner ) on instagram , tik tok , and facebook mindlessly scroll between set .
this be one of the fast way to lose precious minute in your workout , and not lose focus .
i tell my client that if they have enough time to do mindless thing between set , they have rest long enough .
you should be work hard enough to warrant your rest period , which typically consist of you sit down , catch your breath , shake your muscle , and mentally recover for your next set .
any more than that , and you be just wait time .
7. time your rest period i often find beginner either rest no time at all or rest an eternity between set .
both be wrong .
the reality be , most beginner can get by rest 90 second between set .
this allow you to recover from a tough set , but also keep the stimulus on the muscle enough between set to have a compounding fatigue effect ( basically , over the course of the workout you want the muscle to tire out ) .
while more advanced lifter may need long than 2 minute , most beginner be not strong enough relative to their body mass and ability to warrant a very long rest period like you would see in elite - level powerlifters .
< END > < START > start a fitness journey can be intimidate .
there be workout to learn , diet to follow , willpower to conjure , and self - consciousness to overcome .
but make the decision to start a fitness regimen and make stride toward improve your health be the absolute best thing you can do for yourself — mind and body .. here , eric answer the most common training question he get from people who be start their quest toward fitness .
i do not know how to use the equipment or do any workout .
how do i get start ?
as a complete beginner , the gym can certainly be an intimidating place .
this be why i suggest hire a personal trainer for a good eight to 10 session .
he or she can teach you what muscle group each piece of equipment work , as well as proper exercise technique , breathe pattern , and rep cadence .
a good trainer will also help you develop a workout program that be suit to your present level of fitness , particular goal , and that address any injury or limitation that you may have .
what type of training should i do to lose weight ?
when it come to lose weight , you need a combination of weight / resistance training and cardiovascular exercise .
many people make the error of perform too much cardio and neglect weightlifting , think that only treadmill , stationary bike , and stair stepper be responsible for burn fat — but this be far from true .
while cardio will certainly help you burn extra calorie , it be weight train that be go to stimulate the metabolism ( so that you become a fat - burning machine ) , change the composition of your body , and bring about the shape and contour you want .
i suggest at least three to four day per week lift weight and four to five perform cardio — preferably first thing in the morning or right after resistance training .
person grip a barbell for a romanian deadlift exercise what type of training should i do to build strength and muscle ?
for building strength and muscle , you will need a well - design weight train program that primarily utilize free weight and compound ( multi - joint ) exercise .
a four - day - per - week program work quite well for most , use a two on , one off ; two on , two off pattern .
this allow you to hit each muscle group hard once per week , while provide you three day for rest and recovery ( which be when actual growth take place ) .
i suggest start with about four exercise for three set each for major muscle like back , quad , hamstring , chest , and shoulder .
for small group like biceps , triceps , trap , ab , forearm , and calf , you will do well with just three movement for two to three set each .
perform one to three warmup set before each exercise ( more be need earlier in the workout ) , and then work set of 13 to 15 , 10 to 12 , and 7 to 9 reps. beginner workout how often do i need to work out ?
how often you need to work out depends on your fitness level , goal , and time limitation .
the lofty the goal , the more time you will have to spend go after it .
that say , if you have a very demanding job , a family , or other important personal responsibility , you may not be able to spend hour per week work out .
then you will need to be patient when it come to reach your goal .
to make decent progress you need to hit the gym at least three day per week for an hour at a time .
however , as time pass , you will begin to require more time in order to see continued progress .
i suggest start out with three gym session per week and add to your program every month or so .
how much time should i spend in the gym ?
like the last question , this depend on how fit you currently be , what goal you have set for yourself , and how much time you have to devote to work out .
for some people it may be best to schedule three hour - long workout per week , while others may find it more convenient and beneficial to train five to six day per week — but for only 30 minute .
in other word , it be best to think about how many total hour per week you will spend in the gym , and then decide how best to spread it out .
another important point to consider be quality of time and not just quantity .
someone who be very dedicated and focus on their training can often get far more accomplished in just 30 minute than someone who be there for an hour , but constantly distract by their phone , chat with others , and watch rather than do .
rest how much rest do i need ?
certain exercise be far more demand on the body than others and require more rest between set .
for example , a set of 15 rep of barbell squat will not only tax the thigh , glute , and low back , but will also have you breathe like a freight train .
you may find that you need a good three to four minute before you be ready to get to the next set .
on the other hand , perform 15 dumbbell side lateral may only require 45 to 60 second of recovery time .
another point to consider be what your primary goal be and how weight training will work best to reach it .
someone who be in the gym to build massive size and power will want to rest for long period in between set so as to be able to lift maximum weight for maximum reps. when you be look to burn body fat and increase endurance , it be best to keep heart rate elevate and move quickly from set to set , even if the weight be lighter .
as for between workout , you may find that as a beginner that a full day of rest be need in between weight training session .
however , as you progress and become more resilient , it be possible to train for day without a break , just as long as you never work the same muscle two day in a row .
cardio can be do daily .
should i start a supplement regimen ?
in the beginning of your health and fitness journey , the main focus should be on implement an intelligent and efficient workout regimen and a healthy and balanced nutrition program .
anyone who tell you to immediately jump on all sort of sport supplement be either misinformed or try to make a buck ( well , most of them ) .
after spend eight to 12 solid week in the gym , work hard and consistently while carefully follow a sound diet , it be appropriate to think about add supplement into the mix .
be there really a 30- to 60 - minute window to consume protein post - workout ?
why ?
it be actually true that within the first hour after work out intensely with weight , the body be in a special metabolic state where protein and carbohydrate be partition toward muscle and away from fat cell .
this be because during this period , insulin sensitivity be extremely high , which mean amino acid and carbs will very readily be absorb , assimilate , and store directly into damage muscle cell .
this allow for repair , recovery , and recuperation to start immediately , and over time you will get far good result than eat your post - workout meal outside of this anabolic window .
out of shape training i be severely out of shape .
be there anything that be not safe for me to do ?
while it be likely safe for you to begin a light workout program , preferably under the care of an experienced and educate personal trainer , it would be best for you to consult with your physician before even step into a gym .
get the green light from your doc will give you peace of mind and keep you from needlessly cause yourself harm , illness , or injury , especially when you be take step to improve your health and wellness .
do not be dishearten ; just talk to your doctor first to get a physical and come up with a strategy .
do you recommend any non - workout activity to get fit ?
absolutely , yes .
not only be outside activity great for your body , they have be prove to improve your mental wellbeing — depression be often a factor for people who find it difficult to get in shape .
these type of activity be especially great when it come to get in your cardiovascular training .
it be far more enjoyable to hike , dance , bike , run stair , or swim than to walk on a treadmill every session .
body fat caliper how do i know my training be work ?
what performance measure should i be track ?
carefully track your progress be extremely important when embark on any kind of physical fitness program .
if possible , it be a good idea to meet with a coach or trainer every two to four week to have your weight , body fat , and complete measurement take .
you can take it a step far by have regular blood test via your primary physician if you be try to regulate general health measure like total cholesterol , ratio of ldl to hdl , triglyceride , and blood pressure .
oddly enough , a very good indicator of progress be feel how your clothes fit .
obviously if you be look to get big and more muscular , you know you be head in the right direction if your shirt be fit tighter in the arm , chest , and through the back .
the scale be not always a telltale sign of whether your program be yield result , since it be very possible for people , especially woman , to drop several size without lose a single pound .
always remember that muscle weigh more than fat , but it take up far less space .

< END > < START > there be pretty much no science behind the cool - down advice .
the cool - down , doctor say , “ be an understudied topic .
” ” everyone think it be an establish fact , ” he add , “ so they do not study it .
” it be not even clear what a cool - down be suppose to be .
some say you just have to keep move for a few minute  walk to your car after you finish a run rather than stop abruptly and stand there .
others say you have to spend 5 to 10 minute do the same exercise , only slowly .
after your run , then transition into a walk .
still others say that a cool - down should include stretch .
and it be not clear what the cool - down be suppose to do .
some say it alleviate muscle soreness .
others say it prevent muscle tightness or relief strain on the heart .
exercise researcher say there be only one agree - on fact about the possible risk of suddenly stop intense exercise .
when you exercise hard , the blood vessel in your leg be expand to send more blood to your leg and foot .
and your heart be pump fast .
if you suddenly stop , your heart slow down , your blood be pool in your leg and foot , and you can feel dizzy , even pass out .
the best athlete be most vulnerable , say doctor , a cardiologist and marathon runner who be an exercise researcher at hartford hospital in connecticut .
“ if you be well trained , your heart rate be slow already , and it slow down even faster with exercise , ” he say .
“ also , there be big vein with a large capacity to pool blood in your leg .
” that effect can also be deleterious for someone with heart disease .
“ that be always a concern , ” doctor say .
“ but to my knowledge there be not a wealth of experimental data .
” but do it matter for the ordinary , average athlete ?
“ probably not a great deal , ” doctor say .
and , anyway , most people do not just stand there , stock still , when their workout be over .
they walk to the locker room or to their house or car , get the cool - down benefit without officially “ cool down .
” the idea of the cool - down seem to have originate with a popular theory  now know to be wrong  that muscle become sore after exercise because they accumulate lactic acid .
in fact , lactic acid be a fuel .
it be good to generate lactic acid , it be a normal part of exercise , and it have nothing to do with muscle soreness .
but the lactic acid theory lead to the notion that by slowly reduce the intensity of your workout you can give lactic acid a chance to dissipate .
yet , doctor say , even though scientist know the lactic acid theory be wrong , it remain entrench in the public be mind .
“ it be an idea we ca not get rid of , ” he say .
in fact , doctor say , one study of cyclist conclude that because lactic acid be good , it be well not to cool down after intense exercise .
lactic acid be turn back into glycogen , a muscle fuel , when cyclist simply stop .
when they cool down , it be waste , use up to fuel their muscle .
as far as muscle soreness go , cool down do not do anything to alleviate it , doctor say .
and there be no physiological reason why it should .
that be also the conclusion of a study of muscle soreness by south african researcher who ask 52 healthy adult to walk backward downhill on a treadmill for 30 minute  an exercise that can cause sore leg muscle .
the participant be randomly assign to cool down by walk slowly uphill for 10 minute or simply to stop exercising .
the result , the researcher report , be that cool down do nothing to prevent sore muscle .
and muscle tightness ?
“ in a different generation we would have call it an old wife tale , ” doctor say .
“ now i guess i would call it an old physiologist tale .
there be no data to support the idea that a cool - down help .
” but , he add , once again , “ it be an idea we ca not get rid of .
” exercise researcher say they act on their own advice .
doctor say if he be do a really hard track workout he will jog for a short distance when he finish to avoid become dizzy .
if he run a half marathon , he will “ start shuffle forward , ” after he cross the finish line , for the same reason .
as for doctor , he do not cool down at all .
he be a soccer player and , he say , he see no particular reason to do anything after exercise other than just stop .

it be not optimal , but you can build muscle and improve your physique with even a few small workout .
the real revelation be that 15 - minute workout will only work as hard as you do .
they be a workout type that trade time efficiency for hard , ball - to - the - wall work while you be do them .
they require you to push the pace for 15 minute to fit more work into less time .
this be why 15 - minute workout be not more popular : you can fit an hour of workout into 15 minute if you be work 400 percent harder .
it be a simple but brutal workout style that can build ton of result in nearly no time , but it require a lot of grit and willingness to keep push when tire .
time - efficiency : how to make good short workout how do you make a 15 - minute workout effective for build muscle mass ?
we have put together a shortlist of the most important thing you can do to ensure that your 15 - minute workout be build muscle and help you progress .
improve intensity this be the most important factor : work harder .
you be not spend much time exercise , so you need to make sure it be spend at the absolute limit of what you can do – safely and with good technique / movement .
this mean less rest , more challenge , and start near the maximum of what you can do .
that mean work on challenge exercise and reps the whole time and be willing to step down to a simpler or light exercise as fatigue set in ; just do not stop .
less rest if you be do a 15 - minute workout , you want to make sure there be as much exercise as possible – and as little rest as possible .
the work need to take up all of the time while rest be cut back or remove completely .
it be more important to stay work to provide more mechanical tension and metabolic stress in the muscle .
this be what cause muscle growth , and – with 15 minute of consistent high - effort work – you can put far more in with less rest .
you want to take some rest – but try and structure it .
if you be spend 15 minute , try set out 45 second on , 15 second off rest structure .
if you can do even less , you will spend more time building muscle and catch your breath less .
a smooth , consistent pace for 15 minute mean a ton of work – and all the muscle that build .
more often one of the easy way to make your workout more effective be to do more of them .

the actual effect on your body may be less than a longer workout , but that mean you will be able to work out more often without overtraining .
training for 15 minute every day of the week still add up to nearly 2 hour of constant exercise if you be push the pace .
that be more than most people spend exercise across 3 , 1 - hour session .

, arm and back / bi ) .

the more you be willing to work in the 50 - 75 percent range for your workout , the more you will get do .
you can start with heavyweight , but the focus should be on do ton of work with back - off set and try to build more work capacity .

eat a healthy diet .
by follow these tip , you can improve your long - distance endurance and achieve your run goal .
follow the 10- to 15 - percent rule many overuse injury happen because runner increase mileage too quickly .
new runner who ramp up volume too fast be especially vulnerable to injury , because their bone , tendon , ligament , and muscle have not yet be condition to withstand the impact of run .
but even season runner can get hurt from build too quickly .
“ i have see runner who use to do 100 mile per week get hurt while they be only at 60 per week , because they build up incorrectly , ” .
“ just because you use to do a certain amount of mile do not mean you can pick up right where you leave off .
” that say , runner who have run high mileage in the past can usually increase their mileage more rapidly than those who have not , since their body have already adapt to high - volume training at one time .
regardless of your previous experience with mileage , all runner should follow the 10- to 15 - percent rule : calculate what 10 to 15 percent of your goal weekly mileage be , then increase your mileage each week by no more than that amount .
for example , if your goal be to run 60 mile per week , you should increase your mileage each week by no more than six to nine mile .
if you usually run 10 mile per week , increase by no more than 1 to 1.5 mile the following week .
build for three week , rest for a week another key to building mileage safely be to give your body a “ down week .
” in the same way that you should not run hard every day , you should not try to up your mileage every week .
he recommend increase mileage for three week , and then take the fourth week “ down , ” by run a low weekly mileage and more easy run than the week before .
for example , if you aim to run 60 - mile week , you may run week of 40 mile , 46 mile , and 52 mile , and then drop back down to 46 mile in the fourth week .
this relative resting period give your legs time to absorb the mileage and build critical muscle memory before tack on more mile .
“ develop and maintain consistency in your running be really important , ” “ any type of change on the body — include mileage — be really stressful , which be why so many injury happen during buildup phase .
once your body be comfortable in a certain mileage , it be very easy to keep do that week after week .
” increase your long run gradually , too because many recreational runner who be train for marathon do the bulk of their weekly mileage in a weekly long run , it can be tempt to increase mileage by simply ramp up long run .
but this method can be especially hazardous , since extend time on your foot while you be already tire can result in sloppy form and leave you more prone to injury .
he recommend that runner increase long run by 10- to 15 - percent each week , with a down week every fourth week , in the same way that you increase your overall mileage .
for the runner who be build to 60 - mile week with a peak long run of 20 mile , the four - week pattern could look like this : 40 mile ( 10 - mile long run ) 46 mile ( 12 - mile long run ) 52 mile ( 14 - mile long run ) 46 mile ( 12 - mile long run ) take it easy while you be build mileage , your focus should be on complete the distance , not hit a certain pace .
a common mistake runner make be increase both volume and intensity at the same time , which can lead to overuse injury or burnout .
speed work be especially ill - advise while run in the heat , because your body be already work hard to maintain a give pace .
leave interval for later this year , when the weather be cool and you be prepare to race again .
prioritize fueling and recovery hand down , the best way to successfully build mileage be to recover well .
“ in my experience , runner usually be not overtrained , but under - recovered .
a lot of runner blame their failure on be overtrained when really they just have a bad day , ” while most runner think of recovery as what immediately happen after a workout — cool down , stretch , and foam roll — it involve much more than that .
get a proper amount of sleep , eat the right food and enough of them , strength training regularly , practice mindfulness , and eliminate extra stress be all necessary component of recovery .
sleep and fuel enormously impact athlete train performance , runner often misinterpret sign of sleep deprivation as training fatigue , which can lead to run less when you really just need more sleep .
“ they be get around 8.5 hour of sleep per night , which be more than they have in 10 year , ” and it be pay off in practice : “ their fitness level be great , even though the training environment be not optimal .
” fuel properly be important for any training cycle , but it be especially critical when you be increase mileage , because you have to consume more calorie to keep up with the extra energy you be burn each week .
keep in mind that while count calorie can be helpful in ensure you get enough food , you should not stress about it .
for runner , eat more — especially whole grain , produce , and healthy protein and fat — be always good than eat less , because it ensure that your body have plenty of energy and nutrient to rebuild bone and muscle .
and do not be surprise if you gain a little weight when you be build mileage .
he say that he often gain a few pound during a buildup , but once his body become comfortable with the mileage , his normal appetite return again , and he shed the extra pound .
look out for injury warning sign even if you do everything right while build mileage , injury sometimes happen .
that be just the nature of our high - impact sport .
while overtraining be unlikely to happen if you increase volume slowly and prioritize recovery , if you feel extremely fatigue while run for seven day in a row , you should probably take a few day off .
continue to run on exhausted or achy leg can make you more at risk for develop overuse injury .
if you do develop an injury that change the way you run and alters your gait mechanic , you should have it check out by a doctor .
long - distance run plan tip for begin runner , your mileage can increase by 20 - 25 percent each week .
so , if you be run three or four mile on your long run , you can safely add a mile or so each week to that run .
for more experienced runner aim to increase by no more 10 - 15 percent each week .
this be especially important once your long run distance be upwards of 10 mile or so , these limit will help keep run injury from overtraining at bay , as well as leave you time to have a life outside of training .
the rest of your weekly mileage will happen throughout the week in the form of speed work and easy run .
you will also need to allot time to mobility work .
do not be intimidate if that sound like a lot of train to fit into one week .
there be more detail to come !
every 4th week , decrease the volume of your long run .
this provide ample recovery for your body .
it might seem counter - intuitive to reduce your training volume and run length , but there be a reason for it .
that “ deload ” week provide not only a mental break but also a physical one .
you will have a little more time in your schedule to get in other priority besides training .
this will be especially apparent on your long run day , where the week before you may have run 12 mile , but now you be down to 7. enjoy the extra time and try not to stress that you be lose fitness .
your muscle be busy repair the damage of training so that you can start the following week rest and ready to tackle your goal of long distance .
2. keep your training schedule balance ever go for an epic long run on the weekend , only to then spend 6 day recover from it ?
i be sure we have all be guilty of this at some point .
there be even the term “ weekend warrior ” to describe this unbalanced way of training .
instead , we want to balance our long run with our shorter run so that we be always make progress .
